the equal status and responsibilities of women and men in the public and private spheres.",Implemented,"The Committee expressed its appreciation of the efforts by the State party to re examine the stereotyped content of school curricula and books and welcomed the efforts of the State party, in partnership with the media, to increase the participation of women and to show a positive and diverse image of women in public life. However, the Committee remained concerned about what it described as the persistence of traditional stereotypes regarding the roles and responsibilities of women and men in society and, in particular, within the family (paragraphs 19 and 20 of the concluding observations). In that regard, Bahrain would like to state the following:
85.	Since 2016, the Council has been running a programme in collaboration with the Ministry of Education under the name of the “School Awareness Kit”. The Kit, which is aimed at primary level students in State-run and private schools, includes a number of booklets: a booklet on the Council, a booklet informing students about the goals of the national framework for integrating the development needs of women and about equal opportunity apps, a booklet on the National Plan for the Advancement of Bahraini Women and a guide to train teachers on mechanisms for using the Kit.
86.	The purpose of the Kit is to change the stereotypical image of women in school curricula in a way that reflects the progress made by Bahraini women, promotes their participation and advancement and raises levels of awareness around women’s issues in Bahrain using educational tools such as school curricula. Thanks to the Kit, teachers in State-run schools for both boys and girls, and in private schools, are trained in and made aware of concepts such as integration, equal opportunity and social justice between the sexes. At the same time, students undertake activities, both inside and outside the classroom, and are involved in exhibitions, competitions, publications and other events on the concepts incorporated in the Kit and on related issues such as protecting women from domestic and other forms of violence. Regular field visits to schools are carried out for the purposes of follow-up and evaluation (for further details, see annex 3, which includes examples of publications of the Supreme Council for Women and the booklets included in the School Awareness Kit).
87.	Just as Manama was being designated as “Arab Women’s Capital 2017” by the League of Arab States, Bahrain was hosting a regional workshop on enhancing the image of women in the Arab media. The event — which was held in Manama from 13 to 14 September 2017 in collaboration with the Bahrain National Commission for Education, Science and Culture and the Ministry of Information — was attended by a number of governmental experts on women’s issues and the role of women in building society, and by representatives of media institutions from Arab member States of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). The purpose of the initiative was to empower women in the media, to highlight the role of media outlets in promoting and supporting efforts to empower Arab women, to determine the impact of media content in sustaining those efforts and to correct any misdirection, and to measure what success the media message in the Arab world has had in altering the stereotypical image of woman and in presenting them as active players in the development of society. The workshop recommended that a women’s media observatory be established within OIC. It also encouraged member States to continue to evaluate and develop strategies and plans for the empowerment of women and to evaluate the impact of such plans on media content and its support for the role of women in public life.
88.	The Kingdom of Bahrain has carried out a number of academic studies on women and the media. Of these, the most important was a study analysing women’s programming on Bahraini television between November 2016 and June 2017 and another entitled “the reality of Bahraini women in the media 2013”. The studies concluded that Bahrain television programmes were able to show a modern image of Bahraini women, in keeping with the advanced position they have attained in various fields (see annex 3 for an example of these studies).
89.	Bahrain devoted Bahrain Women’s Day 2013 to the theme of “Women in the Media”. As part of that initiative, a “media rally” competition was organized for young persons of both sexes as a way of contributing to the development of women’s media in various different fields, promoting a positive media image of women, developing a spirit of competition among persons working with women’s issues in the media and encouraging creative media professionals to embrace women’s issues.
90.	Statistics produced by the Council’s media centre show that local news outlets, across various media, dealt in a positive manner with topics relating to women 74.3 per cent of the time in 2017. The leading topic was family stability, which alone accounted for 18.2 per cent of all broadcast content. The statistics also showed a 44 per cent fall in the rate of use of stereotypical or negative images of women in publicity and advertising in 2017 with respect to 2016. In addition, 173 hours of radio broadcasts and 51 hours of television broadcasts were dedicated to women and family programmes in the period 2014–2017.
91.	Bahraini women work in the media in various different capacities where they also occupy non-traditional roles and decision-making positions. For example, women have held the posts of Minister of Culture and Information (from 2008 to 2010), Minister of Media Affairs and the official spokesperson for the Government of Bahrain (2012). In addition, a woman served as Deputy Minister for Radio and Television in 1985 and women have held a number of specialized technical posts including the following: presenter, programme producer, programme coordinator, programme director, programmer, equipment operator, voice technician, newspaper editor and translator.

		
	92.	Challenges and future measures: ensuring sustainable development	
		•	Implementing and following up on recommendations emerging from studies regarding the image of women in the media and the role of the media in highlighting women’s activities in all areas;	
		•	Continuing to promote a positive media message regarding women using all outlets including social media and new communications technologies;	
		•	Using media support methods to promote the participation of women as a key component in the development of various groups in society, including women themselves;	
		•	Continuing to run awareness-raising programmes and seminars for school students and to develop curricula with content that celebrates the advancement of women;	
		•	Continuing to develop academic curricula that promote the image of women and their participation in public life.	",Awareness campaign,High,N,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
BAHRAIN,2011,2018,Article 11(1)(f),"The Committee recommends that the State party:
	(a)	Adopt effective measures to close the wage gap between women and men;
	(b)	Consider ratifying the Equal Remuneration Convention, 1951 (No. 100) of the International Labour Organization;
	(c)	Adopt legislation criminalizing all forms of sexual harassment in the workplace and ensure that such provisions are enforced;
	(d)	Ensure that ministerial decisions placing restrictions on women’s work concern only pregnancy and maternity protection and do not perpetuate occupational segregation or stereotypes regarding the roles and capabilities 
of women.
",Partial,"172.	The Kingdom of Bahrain has adopted a number of measures aimed at bridging the wage gap between men and women and guaranteeing equal remuneration. Article 39 of the Labour Code for the Private Sector promulgated in 2012 prohibits wage discrimination on grounds of sex, origin, language, religion or belief. In addition, the Kingdom of Bahrain has acceded to a number of international conventions that reaffirm the right of women and men to equal pay for equal work, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and Arab Convention No. 15 of 1983 concerning the determination and protection of wages, which stipulates that working women should be paid the same wages as men for equal work.
173.	We wish to reiterate that the Kingdom of Bahrain was ranked first in the Gulf region in terms of closure of the gender pay gap for equal work and in terms of the estimated earned income index, according to the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report for 2017.
174.	With regard to public-sector employees, Legislative Decree No. 48 of 2010 promulgating the Civil Service Act, Prime Ministerial Decree No. 51 of 2012 issuing the implementing regulations for the Civil Service Act promulgated by Legislative Decree No. 48 of 2010 and the amendments thereto, and Prime Ministerial Decree No. 77 of 2013 promulgating the regulations governing the wages, employment benefits and eligibility criteria for employees subject to the Civil Service Act, do not differentiate between men and women in all circumstances, but grant women some benefits that are not granted to men on physiological grounds, such as maternity leave, lactation periods, childcare leave, leave during the iddah period (period following the death of her husband during which a widow may not remarry) and leave on other occasions.
175.	With regard to ratification of the Equal Remuneration Convention, 1951 (No. 100), article 39 of Labour Code No. 36 of 2017 prohibits wage discrimination on grounds of sex, origin, language, religion or belief. 
176.	With regard to the enactment of legislation criminalizing all forms of sexual harassment in the workplace and measures to ensure the enforcement of its provisions, the Bahraini Criminal Code contains general provisions that criminalize sexual harassment both in the workplace and elsewhere. It prescribes penalties for all types of harassment to which victims may be subjected, regardless of whether they are women or men, such as rape, violation of a person’s honour, perpetration of obscene acts, or violation of a woman’s modesty.
	•	Article 344 of the Criminal Code stipulates that: “Anyone who has sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent shall be sentenced to life imprisonment. The penalty shall be a death sentence or life imprisonment if the victim is under 16 years of age. The victim’s lack of consent shall be presumed if she is under 14 years of age.”
	•	Article 345 stipulates that: “Anyone who has sexual intercourse with a female who is over 16 years of age and under 21 years of age, with her consent, shall be sentenced to a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years.”
	•	Article 346 stipulates that: “Anyone who violates a person’s honour against the person’s will shall be sentenced to a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years. The person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment if the victim is under 16 years of age. The victim’s lack of consent shall be presumed if the victim is under 14 years of age.”
	•	Article 347 stipulates that: “Anyone who violates the honour of a person who is over 14 and under 21 years of age, with the person’s consent, shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment.”
177.	Article 348 stipulates that: “The following shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances in the case of the offences defined in the preceding articles of this chapter:
	1.	If the perpetrator is an ascendant, a guardian, a tutor, a person with authority over the victim, or a servant in the victim’s home or the home of any of the aforesaid persons;
	2.	If the perpetrator is a public servant or an officer entrusted with a public service, a clergyman, a medical practitioner or an assistant of any of the aforesaid persons and exploits his office or profession or the trust placed in him;
	3.	If the offence is jointly committed by two or more persons who cooperate in overpowering the victim or take turns in committing the offence;
	4.	If the victim contracts a sexually transmitted disease as a result of the offence;
	5.	If the victim becomes pregnant or loses her virginity as a result of the offence.”
	•	Article 349 stipulates that: “The death penalty shall be imposed if the offences defined in article 344 result in the victim’s death. The punishment shall be a death penalty or life imprisonment if the offences defined in articles 345 and 346 of this Act result in the victim’s death.”
	•	Article 350 stipulates that: “Anyone who commits an indecent act in public shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment not exceeding one year or to a fine not exceeding 100 dinars (BD). Anyone who commits an indecent act with a female shall be liable to the same penalty even if the act is not committed in public.”
	•	Article 351 stipulates that: “Anyone who violates a woman’s modesty, by word or deed, on a public road or in a much-frequented location shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment not exceeding three months or a fine not exceeding BD 20. If the said act is committed by telephone, the same penalty shall be applicable.”
178.	In addition, the Labour Code for the Private Sector No. 36 of 2012 contains a provision which stipulates that a worker may terminate an employment contract without notice, and that such termination shall be deemed to constitute arbitrary dismissal on the part of the employer for which compensation is required, in the event of an assault by the employer or his representative against the worker during or in connection with the performance of his duties by a word or deed that is punishable by law, or if the employer or his representative commits an act that is deemed to be immoral against the worker or a member of his family. 
179.	The Bahraini legislature has also enacted provisions in other legislation that prescribe penalties for cases of sexual harassment by word or deed in the workplace, such as the implementing regulations for the Civil Service Act promulgated by Prime Ministerial Decree No. 51 of 2012, and the Human Resources Regulations of the Constitutional Court, which were promulgated pursuant to Decree No. 22 of 2016 issued by the President of the Constitutional Court. 
180.	With regard to measures to ensure that ministerial decisions placing restrictions on women’s work concern only pregnancy and maternity protection and do not perpetuate occupational segregation or stereotypes regarding the roles and capabilities of women, it should be noted that Decree No. 23 issued by the Minister of Labour in 2013 concerning work for which women may not be employed specified the following two categories: (i) work that is not physiologically appropriate for women; and (ii) work for which pregnant women may not be employed in order to maintain their safety and that of the fetus. This approach is consistent with international standards and relevant conventions, in particular Convention No. 89 concerning Night Work of Women Employed in Industry adopted in San Francisco on 9 July 1948. The Decree underscores that occupational segregation of men and women and stereotypes regarding women’s roles and capabilities should not be perpetuated.
181.	In 2000 the Kingdom of Bahrain ratified the Convention concerning Discrimination in Respect of Employment and Occupation, 1958 (No. 111), which rejects any distinction, exclusion or preference made on the basis of race, colour, sex, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin, which has the effect of nullifying or impairing equality of opportunity or treatment in employment or occupation.
182.	Article 29 of the Labour Code for the Private Sector No. 36 of 2012 stipulates that all provisions governing the employment of workers shall be applicable to women without discrimination where their employment conditions are similar. Article 33 prohibits employers from dismissing a female worker or terminating her employment contract owing to marriage or during maternity leave.

		
	183.	Challenges and future measures: ensuring sustainable development	
		•	Measures to continue implementing the national framework for the integration of women’s needs into the Government’s programme of action;	
		•	Measures to continue promoting the role of equal opportunity committees in public-sector and private-sector institutions;	
		•	Continuous raising of awareness among employers of the importance of applying the principle of equality of opportunity in recruitment, promotion, training and other activities.	",Legislation/policy change,High,N,,,,,,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
BAHRAIN,2011,2018,Article 12,"The Committee recommends that the State party:
	(a)	Take appropriate measures to ensure that female migrant workers have access to free emergency medical services;
	(b)	Consider undertaking legal amendments to allow abortion in cases of rape and incest, with a view to protecting the best interests of the victim, and to remove punitive measures imposed on women who undergo an abortion in such cases, in the light of its general recommendation No. 24 on women and health. ",Partial,"191.	Following the dialogue concerning the third report of the Kingdom of Bahrain, the Committee recommended, in paragraph 41 of the concluding observations, that the State take appropriate measures to ensure that women have access to a caesarean section and medical treatment without the consent or permission of any other person, including their husband. We wish to reiterate in this regard that a husband’s consent is not required for his wife to undergo any operation, including a caesarean section, and that the only consent required is that of the woman herself. The Ministry of Health has adopted a clear-cut procedural policy in this regard. The details have been circulated to all health-care workers and posted on its internal website.
192.	With regard to the recommendation to take appropriate measures to ensure that female migrant workers have access to free emergency medical services, the Kingdom of Bahrain reiterates that there are no so-called migrant workers in Bahrain. In any case, a bill on health insurance that is currently being discussed by the legislature contains several provisions that guarantee access for foreigners to emergency medical services free of charge. Employers are also required to ensure that foreign employees have access to mandatory health insurance services.
193.	Articles 321 to 323 of the Criminal Code permit abortion under medical supervision in specific cases. The regulations governing the medical profession permit physicians to perform an abortion when it is necessary to save a woman’s life.

BAHRAIN,2011,2018,General recommendation 19,"In the light of its general recommendation No. 19 on violence against women and its previous recommendation (CEDAW/C/BHR/CO/2, para. 25), the Committee urges the State party to put in place a comprehensive national strategy and programme to address all forms of violence against women and:
	(a)	To expedite the adoption of the bill to combat domestic violence, criminalize violence against women and provide for effective remedies and sanctions;
	(b)	To revise the Penal Code, repealing any provisions contained therein that condone acts of violence against women, such as articles 334 and 353, and including provisions to criminalize marital rape;
	(c)	To provide mandatory training to judges, prosecutors and the police on the dynamics of violence against women and on gender-sensitive procedures to deal with women victims of violence;
	(d)	To systematically collect data on violence against women and girls, disaggregated by sex, age and relationship between victim and perpetrator;
	(e)	To ensure that women and girls who are victims of violence, including domestic violence, have access to effective protection and that perpetrators are prosecuted and punished;
	(f)	To take measures to ensure that the lack of reported cases of rape is not due to victims’ fear of retribution or stigma or a sign of lack of confidence in the police and judicial authorities;
	(g)	To address the traditional cultural attitudes preventing women from reporting cases of violence, including through educational and awareness-raising programmes for the general public about the criminal nature of all forms of violence against women.",Partial,"With reference to paragraphs 21, 22, 23 and 24 of the Committee’s concluding observations, Bahrain would like to state as follows:
94.	Article 1 of the Domestic Violence Act No. 17 of 2015 defines domestic violence in the following terms: “Any act of abuse that occurs within the family setting and that is perpetrated by ‘the aggressor’ against ‘the victim’.” Acts of abuse are divided into four categories, defined as follows:
	•	Physical abuse: attacking the physical integrity of the victim by any means; 
	•	Psychological abuse: any act that causes psychological harm to the victim, including insults and slander; 
	•	Sexual abuse: according to the Act, this involves any of the following actions by the aggressor towards the victim: 
		(a)	Sexual assault, or the coercion or exploitation of the victim, using any means, to satisfy the sexual desires of the aggressor or of a third party; 
		(b)	Exposing the victim to sexual materials or sexualized behaviour; 
	•	Economic abuse: any act that deprives the victim of the right or freedom to dispose of personal assets, in such a way as to cause harm to the victim.
95.	The Act also includes provision for protection orders, which are issued by the Office of the Public Prosecution, the competent court or the investigating magistrate to protect the victim in circumstances set forth in the Act. In addition, chapter II of the Act stipulates measures of protection from domestic violence. Article 7 states that the Ministry (i.e., the Ministry of Labour and Social development) shall provide the following services and take the following measures to curb domestic violence, in coordination with all official bodies, each with its own jurisdiction:
	•	Action to raise public awareness of the dangers and impact of domestic violence;
	•	Compilation and dissemination of adequate information on family guidance as well as on treatment, rehabilitation and shelter services, how to access such services and the bodies that provide them;
	•	Provision of adequate shelters for domestic violence victims, also the provision of treatment and rehabilitation, how to access such services and the bodies that provide them;
	•	Provision of family, psychological, social and health-care guidance services, as well as rehabilitation services for aggressors and victims of aggression;
	•	Provision of legal assistance to victims, if necessary;
	•	Monitoring of criminal proceedings concerning domestic violence through the presence of a representative during court sessions;
	•	Provision of specialized training programmes and lectures on domestic violence for law enforcement officers, judicial officials and prosecutors;
	•	Dissemination of data on domestic violence and on means for preventing domestic violence without undermining personal freedom and privacy;
	•	Creation of a hotline to receive reports and complaints of domestic violence;
	•	Development of national indicators to monitor cases of domestic violence, in collaboration with the competent authorities.
96.	Article 9 of the Act requires the Office of the Public Prosecution and the police to protect society and to safeguard confidentiality. Under article 15 of the Act, the Office of the Public Prosecution may issue a protection order, either on its own volition or at the request of the victim, under which the aggressor is required not to interfere with the victim, not to damage the personal property of the victim and not to approach protected areas or any location stated in the protection order.
97.	On the occasion of the 2015 edition of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, which falls every year on 25 November, the Supreme Council for Women launched its national strategy to protect women from domestic violence. The strategy — which focuses on the following main themes: prevention, protection, services, laws and legislation, awareness-raising and media support, studies and research, and evaluation and follow-up — was drafted by a national team including representatives from all competent ministries, official institutions and civil society organizations. An action plan for the strategy has been devised, which includes precise indicators for the various stages of implementation, reflecting the mandate of each institution involved.
98.	A number of executive decrees have been issued to give effect to the Domestic Violence Act:
	•	Decree No. 7 of 2017 issued by the Minister of Justice, Islamic Affairs and Awqaf designating certain personnel of the Ministry of Labour and Social Development as law enforcement officials in order to give effect to article 6 of the Domestic Violence Act No. 17 of 2015;
	•	Decree No. 26 of 2017 issued by the Minister of Labour and Social Development regarding conditions and procedures for licensing family guidance centres.
99.	The rate of domestic violence against Bahraini women, as a proportion of all Bahraini women, dropped in 2015 to 0.39 per cent in 2015 from 0.41 per cent in 2014, following the enactment of the Domestic Violence Act No. 17 of 2015 and the launch of the national strategy to protect women from domestic violence.
100.	As regards penalties against perpetrators of domestic violence, the Domestic Violence Act refers to the general provisions set forth in the Criminal Code. Offences involving the family are contemplated in the Code under articles 316 to 332, offences against the person in articles 333 to 372 and offences against property in articles 373 to 400. Nonetheless, the Domestic Violence Act does establish two penalties, one regarding infringements of protection orders and the other concerning the creation of unauthorized family guidance centres.
101.	Work has been done to amend the Bahraini Criminal Code regarding crimes against the person, in particular the following articles:
	•	A bill to repeal article 353 of Decree-Law No. 15 of 1976 promulgating the Criminal Code, according to which a person who commits rape shall be exempt from punishment if he marries his victim. The bill has been referred to the legislature;
	•	A bill to amend article 344 of Decree-Law No. 15 of 1976 promulgating the Criminal Code, which addresses one aspect of sexual assault: i.e., when the female is under the age of 16;
	•	A bill to amend article 16 (the use of violence justified by custom) and article 334 (which envisages a mitigated penalty for a husband who comes across his wife committing adultery). It should be stated once again that so-called honour crimes do not exist in Bahrain.
102.	With regard to the recommendation to provide mandatory training to judges, prosecutors and the police on violence against women and on how to deal with victims of such violence, the Institute for Judicial Studies organizes integrated training courses and specialized workshops run by local and international experts or sends participants to external training courses.
103.	The Office of the Public Prosecution provides similar training to members of the public though courses and lectures to raise people’s awareness and educate them about the rights of women, the legal, social and psychological protection available to them and the importance of reporting any kind of violence against women.
104.	In December 2017, Bahrain launched its national statistical database on domestic violence — “Takatof” — coinciding with a global campaign against violence against women. The launch, which came within the framework of the national strategy to protect women from domestic violence and involved cooperation between the Supreme Council for Women and the Ministry of the Interior, was attended by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Executive Director of UN Women, a representative from the League of Arab States, representatives from the judiciary, the legislature and the executive, members of diplomatic missions to Bahrain, civil society organizations and a large number of journalists. The purpose of the database is to monitor and follow-up on cases of domestic violence via a sophisticated electronic platform and to produce a consolidated register of domestic violence and its effects on victims. The database uses standardized definitions and classifications of violence with a view to facilitating research and producing statistics that will improve the international standing of Bahrain in that regard.
105.	The Council runs permanent awareness-raising and legal culture programmes, and it produces educational booklets on protecting women from domestic violence, the economic rights of women, the Family Code and other subjects (for further details, see annex 3).
106.	The women’s support centre of the Supreme Council for Women assists female victims who have suffered violence. It receives complaints, offers guidance and psychological counselling, provides rehabilitation services run by specialists and experts, and gives high-quality advice and legal assistance. In addition, it works to conclude legal reconciliation agreements between husband and wife.
107.	Family protection offices have been set up in police stations in a number of governorates in Bahrain. They receive reports of domestic violence and provide services to prevent and treat the phenomenon within an appropriate environment that respects the privacy of the family and the methodology for treating cases of violence. In view of the success of this experiment, the Minister of the Interior has issued a decree to expand it and open family protection offices in police stations in all governorates.
108.	Under Decree of the Public Prosecutor No. 1 of 2016, a special prosecutor’s office for family and children was set up, headed by a female judge holding the rank of judge of the Supreme Court of Appeal. The new office is responsible for taking the necessary protection measures vis-à-vis women who are subjected to violence, intervening promptly to stop that violence, providing psychological, social and legal support to victims within a safe environment and punishing offenders.
109.	Services available via the Ministry of Labour and Social Development’s child protection centre and the children’s emergency helpline:
	•	Emergency support services for children;
	•	Care for children exposed to physical or mental abuse;
	•	Health care and psychological, social and educational counselling;
	•	Coordination of legal services;
	•	Temporary or permanent foster care in cases of extreme need;
	•	Rehabilitation of children and families and preparation for the reintegration of the child into the family.
110.	In addition, female police offices provide the following services in the child protection centre:
	•	They receive reports from police stations, hospitals, health centres and schools, as well as anonymous reports, at all times including on weekends and official holidays;
	•	Recording victims’ accounts at the centre or in hospitals;
	•	Accompanying victims to the Office of the Public Prosecution and the medical examiner and, as required, undertaking field visits;
	•	Following up on cases from birth to the age of 15.
111.	Family guidance offices in social centres run by the Ministry of Labour and Social Development have played a positive role in gaining access to victims of violence and offering them guidance and protection. Workshops and meetings are held periodically with families at the social centres. Cases involving violence against women are monitored via the shelter for victims of domestic violence (Dar al-Aman) and via police stations. Seven family guidance offices have been set up in social centres across all the governorates of Bahrain, in addition to one office of the child protection centre.
112.	Dar al-Aman, the shelter for victims of domestic violence established in 2006, is a State-run institution that comes under the Ministry of Labour and Social Development and is administered by an NGO. It gives temporary shelter to female victims of violence and their young children. It also provides assessment and social support, family and psychological guidance as well as legal counselling to victims of violence. The services are delivered by a staff of male and female social workers, doctors, psychiatrists and legal experts. Childcare is also available. The home is open 24 hours a day and refers cases to the competent authorities, either during the period shelter is being provided or afterwards, in coordination with government and private agencies.
113.	Services available in Dar al-Aman:
	•	Care and rehabilitation with a view to re-socializing the victim and reconstructing their personality;
	•	Follow-up on cases where a person has been reintegrated into their own family to ensure that they are not again subjected to violence and that they are able to adapt to their family and social surroundings;
	•	Programmes and training courses on the rehabilitation of women who have been subjected to violence;
	•	A workshop to help women reintegrate into the labour market;
	•	A sports club to promote women’s physical health;
	•	A nursery for children.
114.	Victims or any member of their family have the right to report an incident of domestic violence. Likewise, anyone who becomes aware of an incident of domestic violence by virtue of the exercise of their profession in medicine or education has a duty to inform the Office of the Public Prosecution, the police, Dar al-Aman or the child protection centre. The Office of the Public Prosecution and the police are under an obligation to protect the party reporting the incident by not disclosing their name or identity unless otherwise required in the course of legal proceedings. In addition, the statements of the parties involved and of any witnesses, including children, are to be taken in appropriately equipped rooms. All persons involved must be allowed to make their statements freely and confidentially, and all communications, correspondence and proceedings regarding cases of domestic violence are to be kept confidential.
115.	The Committee recommended that measures be taken to ensure that the lack of reported cases of rape is not due to victims’ fear of retribution or stigma or a sign of lack of confidence in the police or the Office of the Public Prosecution. However, that recommendation is out of place in the light of the constant care Bahrain takes to disseminate awareness regarding women and how to protect them and ensure that they can enjoy their rights on an equal footing with men. Bahraini society in general, and Bahraini women in particular, are advanced enough to know that they can inform the authorities about any possible situation they may face, especially cases of rape, without fear of any kind and with full confidence in the State’s ability to protect them and to pursue wrongdoers and bring them to trial. This is because criminal procedural law envisages protection for persons making statements. In fact, according to witness protection provisions contained in section I (5) and in section VI of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the statements of witnesses and victims are to be taken without revealing their identity, in addition to other protection measures.

FINLAND,2008,2013,"Article 2, Article 3",- Ensure the issue of discrimination is given visibility and attention,Implemented,"The Commission preparing the reform of the non-discrimination legislation submitted its Report on Measures to Combat Discrimination in December 2009. The Commission proposed that the non-discrimination legislation be amended in such a way that the prohibition of discrimination would cover all public and private activities, with the exception of private life and family life. The legal protection against discrimination would be uniform for all discrimination grounds covered in the legislation. The report contains a proposal that the obligation to promote non-discrimination also would cover providers of education and training as well as employers. The Commission proposed that an Ombudsman for Equal Treatment would replace the Ombudsman for Minorities and monitor all forms of discrimination. However, in the case of working life, the industrial safety authorities would monitor the prohibition of discrimination. The observance of the legislation regarding equality between women and men would still be monitored by the Ombudsman for Equality. The Discrimination Tribunal and the Equality Board, both having had few cases before them, would be merged. The purpose of merging the two bodies is to gain benefits from synergy, while making it possible to address multiple discrimination.

The three-year term of the Discrimination Monitoring Group that operates in connection with the Ministry of the Interior was renewed in 2008. The task of the Monitoring Group is to collect information for the Government on the realization of fundamental rights, in order to facilitate the improvement of the anti-discrimination policy in various areas of life. The Monitoring Group has elaborated a Plan of Action for the years 2010 - 2013 and has continued to develop its follow-up system set up during its previous term. The purpose of the follow-up system is to raise awareness of multiple discrimination and to monitor gender-based discrimination from the point of view of multiple discrimination.

In 2008, the report ""Discrimination in Finland"" was elaborated as part of the follow-up system for discrimination. Also gender-based discrimination is covered in the report as well as multiple discrimination. The report encompasses, inter alia, studies on possibilities for conciliation in cases of the Roma avoiding obligation, on discrimination cases in working life before the industrial safety districts as well as a study on discrimination in education and leisure time. The study on discrimination in working life highlighted discrimination against women in working life. The report on discrimination in education and leisure time covered, inter alia, experiences of young persons belonging to sexual and gender minorities in secondary education. A study on discrimination faced by immigrant women in recruitment is under way and will be finalized early in 2012.

The Government adopted an Equality Programme in July 2008 to promote and coordinate measures aiming at improving gender equality. The programme focused on mainstreaming the gender perspective, bridging the gender wage gap, promoting women's career advancement, increasing equality awareness in schools and alleviating segregation, improving reconciliation of family and work responsibilities, decreasing violence against women, strengthening the resources for equality work as well as the compilation of an Equality Report. A joint ministerial monitoring group compiled the final report. It was published on 15 April 2011. The report also contains well formulated measures to promote equality

The Government Programme of Prime Minister Katainen focuses, inter alia, on decreasing poverty, inequality and exclusion. The Government has pledged to improve the equality between women and men and to continue to mainstream the gender perspective. Gender equality as a central objective of society must be taken into account in all political decision-making. Both women and men must be guaranteed equal rights, duties and possibilities. According to the Government Programme, an Equality Programme will be elaborated in the beginning of the electoral period, taking into account the Government Report on Equality between Women and Men adopted by the Parliament in 2010 as well as the final evaluation of the previous Equality Programme. The preparation of a new Equality Programme was initiated in the autumn of 2011.

The Government issued its first Equality Report to the Parliament in October 2010. The Report outlines the equality policy of the Government until 2020. The objective of the Report is to strengthen long-term and systematic promotion of equality between women and men. The Report stresses the need to commit to the implementation of the equality policy on all levels. The report analyses the objectives and measures of the pursued equality policy and their effectiveness as well as the development of gender equality during the last ten years. The topics of the report are decision-making, education and research, working life, reconciliation of family and professional responsibilities, men and equality, violence against women, violence in close relationships and trafficking as well as the position of the equality authority and mainstreaming of the gender perspective. The Equality Report covers the equality policies of the governments since the end of the 1990's. The report covers equality policy in a cross-sectoral manner from the point of view of immigrants and minority groups. Annex 2.

The next Equality Report will be given to the Parliament by the end of 2021 and an intermediary report on the progress in implementing the previous Report by the end of 2016.

Paying attention to the gender perspective is important also on the municipal level, especially when planning and realizing important social reforms. The Government has strengthened its support to the equality work of the municipalities. With partial financing from the European Social Fund, two projects have been initiated with the aim to concretize and build a model for the work to promote equality in the activities of municipalities and the regional and local State Administration. The projects end in 2012 and their budget is 850 000 euro in total.

The Defence Forces have estimated that they are using about 12 person-years on a yearly basis for equality work. This equals to approximately 600 000 euro a year. In connection with the administrative reform of 2008, a new main area of responsibility was established for equality issues at the Ministry of the Interior. It supports and monitors the implementation system of the monitoring of discrimination.

The fourth Equality Barometer by Statistics Finland was published in 2008. The
Barometer examines the estimations and attitudes of Finnish women and men in regard to
gender equality as well as their experiences of the realization of equality in working life, at
school and in the family. The Barometer examines changes over a ten year period. In many
of the aspects that are measured there has not been any change. Some change was noticed,
inter alia, as the strengthening of the role of fathers in the family, as an increase in the
disadvantage experienced at work because of their gender by highly educated women and
as an increase in the sexual harassment experienced by women. The preparation of a new
Equality Barometer 2012 has started.

In the autumn of 2009, the Government started gender mainstreaming and strengthening of the structures for its management (concluding observations, para. 12). The issue was made the object for regular discussion in the Ministerial working group on public administration and regional development. At the same time, it was decided that the realization of mainstreaming of the gender perspective in ministries be discussed regularly in the meetings of the highest officials of the Ministries. In addition to the strengthening of the management structure, also the coordination of mainstreaming has improved in the Ministries. The equality working groups of the Ministries have a key role. The purpose of these working groups is to support the mainstreaming work performed by civil servants of the Ministries. Special areas of focus are law drafting, elaboration of the State budget as well as other projects of importance to equality. However, gender impact assessment is still not very common in the drafting of bills in Ministries.

Paying attention to the gender perspective is important also on the municipal level, especially when planning and realizing important social reforms.

FINLAND,2008,2013,"Article 2, Article 3, General Recommendation 19",- Intensify efforts to prevent and address violence against women and girls,Implemented,"In June 2010, the extended Ministerial Working Group on Internal Security adopted a National Action Plan to Reduce Violence against Women for the years 2010 to 2015. The Action Plan contains 66 measures. No budget is attached to the Action Plan. Implementation plans have already been elaborated for approximately half of the measures of the Action Plan. The measures focus on preventing recurrence of domestic violence, decreasing sexual violence and protecting women in a vulnerable situation. The Action Plan has also been translated into English (annex 3). The international obligations of Finland, such as the Convention and the Concluding observations of the Committee as well as the issues raised in the negotiations on a Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence were taken into account in the drafting of the Action Plan.

In its Programme, the Government endeavours to safeguard the implementation of the National Action Plan to Reduce Violence against Women, to secure an unbroken chain of care for victims of sexual violence and to pay attention to a more even regional distribution of shelters.

The National Action Plan to Reduce Violence against Women was launched through a large campaign. In addition, various authorities and non-governmental organizations have jointly and separately organized several events on violence against women. Distributing fact-based information and raising awareness hold a key position in intensifying measures against violence against women and in moulding attitudes.

An inter-ministerial cross-sectoral working group composed of civil servants was appointed to intensify the coordination of prevention of domestic violence and violence in close relationships. The task of the working group was, inter alia, to coordinate the cooperation between different administrative branches and to strengthen expert resources in the work to combat violence against women. The term of the working group was extended until the end of 2011. The working group reported to the extended ministerial group on national security.

On the municipal level, coordination of prevention of domestic violence and violence in close relationships will be improved by updating the network of municipal contact persons.

The National Institute for Health and Welfare realizes a pilot project to decrease serious violence in relationships and to support victims (MARAK). Also the Police have a central role in the project. The project ended at the end of September 2011 and the assessment of the project will be finalized in the spring of 2012. The Ministry of Justice has granted State subsidies to numerous local crime prevention projects with the aim or with the partial aim to prevent violence against women or domestic violence (annex 4). In addition, the Ministry of Justice supported, in 2011, six crime prevention projects that promote the reduction of violence against women with a total of 72 000 euro.

The Government programme contains provisions on the reform of the sexual crime legislation in such a way that it better secures the right to sexual self-determination. An evaluation report is being prepared at the Ministry of Justice on needs for amendments to the legislation on rape crimes. The intention is to revise the provisions on rape crimes and persecution by presenting a Government Bill to the Parliament on these issues in 2012. According to the 2008 equality barometer and irrespective of their gender, the respondents were of the opinion that the verdicts in rape cases are too lenient. The National Research Institute of Legal Policy finalizes a study on sanctions practices in cases of rape crimes.

Forced marriages will be examined in conjunction with the implementation of the Directive on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting victims.

Petty assault crimes against minors, persons in a close relationship to the perpetrator or against persons who are performing their duties was amended on 1 January 2011 by amendment 1082/2010 from complainant offences to offences under public prosecution.

On 1 June 2011, an amendment to Chapter 20 of the Criminal Code (495/2011) entered into force. Through the amendment, all acts where the perpetrator has sexual relations with the victim by taking advantage of the defencelessness of the victim are defined as rape. Also situations where the victim himself or herself has caused his or her defencelessness are considered rape. The purpose of the amendment is to improve the status of rape victims. Especially women's organizations have criticized the amendment as insufficient and have pointed out that the essential elements of rape crimes are still assessed on the basis of the intention of the perpetrator, rather than on the lack of consent of the victim.

Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse entered into force in Finland on 1 October 2011. The act contains an important number of amendments to existing legislation, which strengthen the rights of children. Information on this is included in Finland's periodic report to the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC/C/FIN/4).

Preparations for the establishment of a Plan of Action on Female Genital Mutilation of Girls were initiated in Finland in 2009. Identification of the issue has been seen as particularly problematic.

A working group of the National Council for Crime Prevention has in a study published in September 2011 attached attention to the prevalence of violence and other crimes against elderly persons and to measures for their prevention. The study analyses the issues from the point of view of both elderly women and elderly men. Increasing the security of elderly persons was included as one of the prioritized fields of State subsidies for crime prevention in 2011. The Ministry of Justice allocated 22 000 euro to a helpline project (Suvantolinja) of the Finnish Association of the Shelters for the Aged. It is a nationwide telephone service free of charge, which provides help, information and guidance for elderly persons having faced ill-treatment, exploitation and violence or threats thereof.

The updated instruction of the Police on restraining orders entered into force on 1 July 2010. The purpose of the instruction is to unify and clarify the activities of police stations. In practice, monitoring of restraining orders is difficult and the reporting of non-compliance with a restraining order hinges in general upon the victim. The Ministry of Justice is analysing possibilities for electronic surveillance in the monitoring of restraining orders.

According to the recommendations of the Council of Europe, violence in close relationships should not be subject to conciliation. According to the instructions of the Prosecutor General of 2007, conciliation should be used primarily in complainant offences. The Ministry of Justice has also stated that custody disputes should not be settled through conciliation in cases involving violence. Good practices for unified nationwide application were elaborated in 2011 on the basis of the practical experience gained from conciliation of violence in close relationships.

In order to develop services for victims of violence, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health and the Association of Finnish Municipalities created recommendations for the municipal social welfare and health services in 2008. The recommendations contain guidelines violence prevention and give instructions on both the organization and on the provision of services.

In the recommendations on domestic and intimate partner violence to the social welfare and health services, local governments are requested to pay attention to the service needs of elderly persons, persons with disabilities as well as children and young persons. The Action Plan to Reduce Violence against Women pays attention to the service needs of groups that are in particularly vulnerable situations. The working group for the reform of the social services legislation discusses proposals regarding an obligation for municipalities to organize emergency and special services for victims of violence. The term of the working group has been extended to 30 June 2012.

There are no secret shelters in Finland. Clients may remain anonymous only while contacting the shelters by phone or in the open services, not while staying at the shelter. The safety of children and their parent may be compromised in a shelter, because a violent guardian of a child has a legal right to know the whereabouts of the child and to meet the child. In 2011, a project was initiated to develop a model for a network of shelters with secret addresses for persons who have experienced serious violence or threats thereof.

Unified quality recommendations for shelters are being elaborated. There are still no nationwide quality recommendations on shelter services. There has not been an increase in shelter services to fulfil international recommendations and shelters are not geographically evenly distributed. Financing of one non-governmental organization offering shelter services has been secured to a more permanent basis through equalization payments. Especially the financial challenges faced by municipalities in the coming years will contribute to making it more difficult to expand the network of shelters sufficiently and diversely.

The objective of the Internal Security Programme is to make shelter services available throughout the country by 2015. The intention is to include a specification of shelter services in the project to reform the social security legislation. The specification of shelter services must take into account the different needs of women in particularly vulnerable situations as well as the provision of shelter services for special groups.

FINLAND,2008,2013,"Article 2, Article 3, General Recommendation 19",- Establish strategy and campaign to prevent and eliminate violence against women and girls,Implemented,"In the nationwide victim study of 2009, women communicated that they had experienced violence most often at their work places (5.2 per cent of the women). According to the study, the violence experienced by women has been somewhat constant during the 2000s and women still experience domestic violence more often than men (1.7 per cent of the women). In approximately half of the cases of domestic violence against women the perpetrator was the current spouse and in a quarter of the cases a former spouse or partner. Two victim studies only on women have been carried out in Finland. They produced higher numbers on violence against women than the nationwide victim surveys, especially on violence in close relationships. The differences may be explained by differences in the questions and in the data collection methods.

In June 2010, the extended Ministerial Working Group on Internal Security adopted a National Action Plan to Reduce Violence against Women for the years 2010 to 2015. The Action Plan contains 66 measures. No budget is attached to the Action Plan. Implementation plans have already been elaborated for approximately half of the measures of the Action Plan.

In its Programme, the Government endeavours to safeguard the implementation of the National Action Plan to Reduce Violence against Women, to secure an unbroken chain of care for victims of sexual violence and to pay attention to a more even regional distribution of shelters.

The National Action Plan to Reduce Violence against Women was launched through a large campaign. In addition, various authorities and non-governmental organizations have jointly and separately organized several events on violence against women. Distributing fact-based information and raising awareness hold a key position in intensifying measures against violence against women and in moulding attitudes.

An inter-ministerial cross-sectoral working group composed of civil servants was appointed to intensify the coordination of prevention of domestic violence and violence in close relationships. The task of the working group was, inter alia, to coordinate the cooperation between different administrative branches and to strengthen expert resources in the work to combat violence against women. The term of the working group was extended until the end of 2011. The working group reported to the extended ministerial group on national security.

On the municipal level, coordination of prevention of domestic violence and violence in close relationships will be improved by updating the network of municipal contact persons.

The National Institute for Health and Welfare realizes a pilot project to decrease serious violence in relationships and to support victims (MARAK). Also the Police have a central role in the project. The project ended at the end of September 2011 and the assessment of the project will be finalized in the spring of 2012. The Ministry of Justice has granted State subsidies to numerous local crime prevention projects with the aim or with the partial aim to prevent violence against women or domestic violence (annex 4). In addition, the Ministry of Justice supported, in 2011, six crime prevention projects that promote the reduction of violence against women with a total of 72 000 euro.

The Government programme contains provisions on the reform of the sexual crime legislation in such a way that it better secures the right to sexual self-determination. An evaluation report is being prepared at the Ministry of Justice on needs for amendments to the legislation on rape crimes. The intention is to revise the provisions on rape crimes and persecution by presenting a Government Bill to the Parliament on these issues in 2012. According to the 2008 equality barometer and irrespective of their gender, the respondents were of the opinion that the verdicts in rape cases are too lenient. The National Research Institute of Legal Policy finalizes a study on sanctions practices in cases of rape crimes.

Forced marriages will be examined in conjunction with the implementation of the Directive on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting victims.

Petty assault crimes against minors, persons in a close relationship to the perpetrator or against persons who are performing their duties was amended on 1 January 2011 by amendment 1082/2010 from complainant offences to offences under public prosecution.

On 1 June 2011, an amendment to Chapter 20 of the Criminal Code (495/2011) entered into force. Through the amendment, all acts where the perpetrator has sexual relations with the victim by taking advantage of the defencelessness of the victim are defined as rape. Also situations where the victim himself or herself has caused his or her defencelessness are considered rape. The purpose of the amendment is to improve the status of rape victims. Especially women's organizations have criticized the amendment as insufficient and have pointed out that the essential elements of rape crimes are still assessed on the basis of the intention of the perpetrator, rather than on the lack of consent of the victim.

Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse entered into force in Finland on 1 October 2011. The act contains an important number of amendments to existing legislation, which strengthen the rights of children. Information on this is included in Finland's periodic report to the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC/C/FIN/4).

The working group that elaborated an action plan against disciplinary violence submitted its report to the Minister of Health and Social Services in October 2010. The working group recommended, inter alia, that families with children be offered support and help in the earliest possible stage, in order to prevent burnout and mental health problems of the parents. One risk group in regard to disciplinary violence is immigrant families, where disciplinary violence may have been accepted in their countries of origin. It is also possible to prevent forms of violence that are especially targeted towards girls, such as honour violence and genital mutilation, through the provision of information on the rights of the child.

According to the 2008 study on child victims, children have less sexual experiences with adults than 20 years ago. On the other hand, they nowadays have more negative sexual experiences than before. Especially online sexual harassment and ""propositions"" experienced by girls are common, but seldom lead to real contact.

The number of crimes related to sexual exploitation of children that have come to the attention of the Police increased between the years 2000 and 2008, but decreased in 2009. It has been estimated that the share of sexual crimes committed against children that comes to the attention of the authorities has grown because of the increase in the general awareness. New technology also makes exploitation easier than before.

A large study on intra-family restraining orders was published in 2009. According to the study, the violence in these restraining order cases had been serious and had gone on for a long time. Temporary intra-family restraining orders often expire because the applicant of the order does not continue the proceedings in the lower courts. According to the study, persons on who a restraining order is imposed had often not received criminal sanctions for the violence in near relationships, even though the violence had gone on for a long time.

The updated instruction of the Police on restraining orders entered into force on 1 July 2010. The purpose of the instruction is to unify and clarify the activities of police stations. In practice, monitoring of restraining orders is difficult and the reporting of non-compliance with a restraining order hinges in general upon the victim. The Ministry of Justice is analysing possibilities for electronic surveillance in the monitoring of restraining orders.

The Government's Programme stipulates that the use of conciliation must be restricted in regard to crimes related to violence in close relationships. There are contradictory views and research results on conciliation and its results, especially for the decrease of violence against women and the respect of women’s human rights. However, nowadays the special features of violence against women are more widely understood. It is understood that in conciliation of violence against women there are two unequal parties - the victim of the violence is often in a weaker and subordinate position in relation to the perpetrator. Even though there are also positive results from conciliation, the starting point cannot be seen as favourable for the achievement of sustainable results.

According to the Act on Conciliation in Criminal and Certain Civil Cases (1015/2005), only the Police and public prosecutor have the right to refer a case to conciliation. Sexual violence cannot be subject to conciliation. The law also prohibits conciliation if the perpetrator has been found guilty of violence earlier in the European Union.

According to the recommendations of the Council of Europe, violence in close relationships should not be subject to conciliation. According to the instructions of the Prosecutor General of 2007, conciliation should be used primarily in complainant offences. The Ministry of Justice has also stated that custody disputes should not be settled through conciliation in cases involving violence. Good practices for unified nationwide application were elaborated in 2011 on the basis of the practical experience gained from conciliation of violence in close relationships.

Annex 5 includes statistics on mediation. The compilation of statistics on conciliation will be developed in such a way that in 2012 statistics on the parties of cases in conciliation will be available differentiated by gender and the position in the proceedings (perpetrator or injured party).

In order to develop services for victims of violence, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health and the Association of Finnish Municipalities created recommendations for the municipal social welfare and health services in 2008. The recommendations contain guidelines violence prevention and give instructions on both the organization and on the provision of services.

The funding of organizations producing violence prevention services is largely based on project funding. Shelters for victims of partner and domestic violence have a central role in providing assistance services.

Crisis telephone counselling constitutes part of the municipal social services. Also several organizations maintain crisis telephone services. Thus far, no free-of-charge 24 hour telephone helplines for victims of violence are in use in Finland. The number of rape crisis centres is lower than the Council of Europe recommendation of one per 200 000 inhabitants.

Thus far, the supply of services for immigrants having faced violence is scarce. Immigrant women seek help from shelters nine times more often than women belonging to the main population. The identification of special features of violence against immigrant women must be systematically developed as well as the assistance provided to such women.

In the recommendations on domestic and intimate partner violence to the social welfare and health services, local governments are requested to pay attention to the service needs of elderly persons, persons with disabilities as well as children and young persons. The Action Plan to Reduce Violence against Women pays attention to the service needs of groups that are in particularly vulnerable situations. The working group for the reform of the social services legislation discusses proposals regarding an obligation for municipalities to organize emergency and special services for victims of violence. The term of the working group has been extended to 30 June 2012.

There are 21 shelters in Finland, the majority of them are run by organizations. The financing of shelters is largely based on municipal promissory notes and contracts on purchase of services. There are 123 family places for victims of violence in close relationships and domestic violence in Finland.

There are no secret shelters in Finland. Clients may remain anonymous only while contacting the shelters by phone or in the open services, not while staying at the shelter. The safety of children and their parent may be compromised in a shelter, because a violent guardian of a child has a legal right to know the whereabouts of the child and to meet the child.

In August 2011, a so called Slut Walk was organized in three municipalities simultaneously. Thousands of persons participated in the march. The media reported on the event by stressing women's rights.

Measures aiming at increasing the security of rural people are important from the point of view of all rural inhabitants. However, inter alia, violence is strongly gender specific in Finland. Women constitute a large majority of the victims of domestic violence, and this should be taken into account in the planning of services for the realization of prevention and care measures in domestic violence cases.

The amended Equality Act (1023/2008) entered into force at the beginning of 2009. The scope of application of the provisions in the Equality Act on prohibition of countermeasures and compensation was broadened to also cover suppliers of generally available goods and services. Efficient sanction can now be imposed on suppliers of goods and services that are guilty of discrimination prohibited in the Equality Act, in the last resort by instituting proceedings for compensation. Also legal remedies were extended to cover prohibited discrimination. The reform also broadened the obligation of employers to provide clarifications on procedures considered discriminatory pursuant to section 10 of the Equality Act. The obligation to provide clarifications now concerns all situations pursuant to Section 8(1) of the Equality Act as well as the prohibition on countermeasures and harassment at working places.

A joint ministerial monitoring group compiled the final report. It was published on 15 April 2011. The report also contains well formulated measures to promote equality

The Government has also endeavoured to continue shrinking the wage gap to at most 15 per cent by 2015. In order to realize this goal, the Government will initiate two wide-ranging research projects. One of the projects covers the impact of the structural change and the changing needs of working life on the employment of women and men, their position on the labour market, integration into the labour market, career development, continuation at work and division of care responsibilities. The other project covers the impact of gender preconceptions and expectations on training and career choices. The Government is also committed to continuing its efforts for the reconciliation of family responsibilities and work by, inter alia, developing the family leave system such that the leaves earmarked for fathers are increased. The Government promotes a well functioning reconciliation of family responsibilities and work to promote new working models.
Statistics on persons having participated in formal training do not indicate any decrease in the share of women. For instance, the share of women and men starting training preparing for vocational complementary training have not changed considerably during the period 2005 to 2009. Women and men start the training in almost equal numbers. The share of women who have started studies for a polytechnic degree as adults has varied during the period 2005 to 2010 between 59.4 and 62.8 per cent (in 2010, 62.8 per cent). The share of women having started specialized polytechnic studies or higher polytechnic studies is clearly bigger than that of men. In the Seniors’ University, a special form of the Open University, the share of women was 76.4 per cent of the 17 258 students in total in 2009.

Adult education benefits were renewed for both unemployed and employed persons in 2010. Unemployed are given the possibility to study in voluntary training without losing their unemployment allowance in cases where it has been agreed as part of the job-seekers job-searching plan or employment plan. In 2010, this possibility was used and studies were initiated by 12 500 persons, 62 per cent of them women. Lifelong learning is supported by lifelong guidance. The Ministry of Education and Culture as well as the Ministry of Employment and the Economy are responsible for the steering of this guidance as a public service. The progress of studies and career and training choices are supported also by various steering and support measures. In addition, the Ministry of Education and Culture has a joint working group for the period of 2010 to 2013 on Lifelong steering. The task of the joint working group is to elaborate strategic objectives for lifelong learning. One of the starting points for the work of the working group is to improve the possibilities of all citizens to obtain guidance services.

The objective of basic education has been to guarantee equal learning opportunities for all. In education, attention is paid to different learners according to their aptitude and intelligence, regardless of gender. The student and student counselling are considered important for the advancement of equality.

The working group for the alleviation of segregation, appointed by the Ministry of Education and Culture in September 2009, proposed 25 measures to alleviate segregation in education and training. The objectives concern all forms of training. The objective is for equality and non-discrimination to be promoted actively and practices preventing equality to be dismantled in the curricula, education, steering and the working culture of the schools (concluding observations, para. 24). The teaching practices of schools and learning institutions are developed in such a way that they support the equal and individual learning and growth of pupils and students, taking into account the social and cultural structure of gender. All students are offered equal opportunities to acquire the information and skills needed in society and working life. Girls and boys are supported through education and student counselling in such a way that they are able to make choices of subjects, studies and career based on their individual attributes, strengths and motivational factors - not gender.

According to the Equality Report, the gender-based wage gap is still a central equality issue in the Finnish society. The Governments have continued together with the labour market organizations the Equal Pay programme, initiated in 2006. The programme continues until 2015. The main objective of the programme is to shrink the gender-based wage gap from the level of 20 per cent in 2006 by at least five per cent until 2015. The progress has been slow. In order to specify the measures, the Government will initiate two large research projects. The average monthly earnings of women were 81.8 per cent of the earnings of men in 2010, while the corresponding figure was 80.9 per cent in 2007 (annex 13).

A new method for promoting equal pay was laid down in the Government programme, namely a commitment to support, with the means of an increased State subsidy, such pay settlements in the municipal sector, that improves the competitiveness of the wages of female dominated occupations. The amount of the increased subsidy depended on how well it was allocated to trained female dominated sectors, where the wages were not congruent with the level of demand of the work. The agreements for the municipal sector concluded in 2007 did contain an appropriation to equalize wages, where the raises were somewhat bigger for female dominated occupations than for other groups. The Government allocated 150 million euro yearly to improve the wages of the occupations in the municipal sector dominated by women. Also the municipal agreement of 2010 did allocate some higher raises to female dominated, relatively low wage professional groups.

Besides supporting the equal pay allocation of the municipal sector, the Government has actively strived to bridge the wage gap through an equal pay programme. The programme promotes, inter alia, the use of fair and encouraging pay systems and an increased use of assessment of the demands of the work, alleviation of gender segregation of labour markets, increasing the share of women in leading positions, reducing the prevalence of temporary contracts, improving the quality and quantity of equality plans for workplaces as well as encouraging an even more balanced distribution of family leaves between the parents.

Equality plans of workplaces constitute one instrument on the level of workplaces to shrink the gender-based wage gap. According to a study, 62 per cent of the workplaces obliged to have one, had an equality plan, and 60 per cent had made a wage survey. The number of plans has grown, but their comprehensiveness and quality still need to be improved. Workplaces have been encouraged and instructed actively to make equality plans and wage surveys.

The Equality Report sets as an objective that working in temporary and part-time jobs in the future be based on the own choice of the employee and that the disadvantages of such work be minimized. Temporary contracts, clearly more common for women, decreased in the 2000s but started to increase again in 2010. In the long term, especially temporary work has increased among women of child-bearing age. The work to improve the terms of work contracts by legislative means has been continued. Part-time work has increased in recent years both among men and women. The relatively largest share of part-time work contracts are found in the State and municipal sector. In 2009, 18 per cent of women and 8 per cent of men were engaged in part-time work. Because of the weakened job situation, the number of temporary employees in 2009 was the smallest since 1997. In 2009, there was a total of 310 000 employees on temporary contracts. In 2009, a third of women aged 25 to 29 years and a little over a fifth of persons aged 30 to 34 years were on temporary contracts. Temporary agency work is a newer form of work. Its volume has been decreasing and in 2009 approximately 23 000 persons were engaged in it, constituting approximately one per cent of the employees.

The main negotiating parties of the State sector cooperate to advance equality in State working places both in negotiations and in separate equality working groups, jointly appointed by the parties for each negotiating period. During the current agreement period, the main trade unions and employers’ associations monitor and evaluate the realization of the measures to promote gender equality in State agencies and compile statistics describing the development of equality and monitor the realization of the equal pay programme in the State sector. The parties assess the gender consequences of the collective agreements for both public servants and employees on the central and local level. Equal pay has also been promoted by separate allocations of funds for equality and equal pay in the collective agreements as well as by attaching special attention also in other agreed raises to the improvement of pay equality between women and men. Gender equality and reconciliation of family and professional responsibilities is also taken into account when negotiating changes to the provisions of the agreements on family leaves.

An increase of women entrepreneurship has been included both in Government Programmes and in the Equality Report. The share of women entrepreneurship is high in an EU-wide comparison, that is a third. Companies of women often operate in the service sector or retail trade. According to women entrepreneurs, there are problems associated with the family leaves. Women entrepreneurship has been supported, inter alia, by loans for entrepreneurs and business start-up money.

The increase in the employment rate continued till 2009, when the employment rate of women was 68 per cent and that of men was 69 per cent. Although the employment rate of women and men does not differ considerably, there are considerable differences in different age groups. In 2008, the difference in the age group 25 to 29 years was 10 per cent and in the age group 30 to 34 years, 15 per cent. The difference is due to the fact that mothers more often than fathers stay at home to care for small children. Unemployment of single mothers is considerably higher than that of other women and they have a lower education. In all age groups from 25 to 54 the unemployment rate of women was higher than that of men and in the age group over 55 years, the unemployment rate of men was more common than of women. Forty per cent of women and 14 per cent of men work in the public sector and in the municipal sector a third of all women. Women participate more actively than men in employment policy measures aiming at improving employment and decreasing unemployment.
Reconciliation of family and professional responsibilities has long been a part of the equality policy. A central goal has been a more even distribution of family leaves between the parents. The compensation paid to employers to cover costs caused by parental leaves has been increased several times. At the moment, a majority of the employer costs of these leaves have been evened out. The system of family leaves has also been altered in order to take into account the diversity of families, inter alia, regarding adoption families and the position of the parent not living with the child. Also persons living in a registered partnership have been granted the right to take family leaves. The solutions in regard to the reconciliation of family and professional responsibilities have been limited to parents of young children and small school children. There is a growing awareness of the needs for flexible solutions to reconcile family and work also in regard to other groups. For instance, a growing number of working age persons also take care of their ageing parents alongside with their professional responsibilities.

In practice, reconciliation of family and professional responsibilities is more difficult for women than for men. For this reason, efforts have been made to intervene in the imbalanced distribution of family responsibilities. An amendment to the legislation that entered into force in the beginning of 2010 increased the maximum length of the so called daddy month to six weeks. The use of the daddy month has increased by over 10 per cent yearly. In particular, fathers have increased the use of the paternal leave and Daddy month right after the delivery of the baby. Despite the positive development, 93 per cent of all parental leaves were used by mothers in 2009. Many fathers still feel that the attitude towards the use of family leaves is negative.

The minimum level of the daily allowance for parents was raised in the beginning of 2009. The reform benefited especially such women who were not entitled to per diem based on their salary, such as students. The child home care allowance and the private day-care allowance were raised in the beginning of 2009. Partial care allowance for parents who work part-time for reasons related to child care was raised in the beginning of 2010 to better compensate the loss of earnings caused by the shorter working hours. Starting in March 2011, the minimum parental allowance, child allowance and home care allowance will be tied to the basic pension index. Most of all the amendment benefits families with small children.

The report of the working group on parental leaves issued in March 2011, analysed the question of a more comprehensive reform of the parental leave system and the encouragement of fathers to increase the use of family leaves as well as the improvement of the compensation of the costs of parenthood to the employers. The working group presented proposals to increase the share of fathers and to achieve a more even distribution of family responsibilities. The working group also analysed alternative ways to compensate the costs caused by parental leaves to the employer. The purpose of the proposals is to promote the position of women on the labour market as well as to support the career development of women. The aim of the Government is to increase the leaves earmarked for fathers, to make the use of parental leaves more flexible for fathers and to enable the care of children at home with the support of a parental allowance for a longer time than what currently is possible.

Because the migration of women from rural areas is so strong that it threatens the vitality of rural communities, special attention has been attached to the increase of employment and entrepreneurship possibilities for women. The gender impact of the general programme has been taken into account especially in regard to housing and services, entrepreneurship and work, know-how as well as in regard to civil activity and local development. In the follow-up of the programme, particular attention is attached to the realization of equality between women and men. For instance, several of the measures aiming at promoting rural life, service and culture also promote the general accessibility of services and employment in the service sectors. Especially well-being services and cultural services provide employment for women.

Efforts are made to rectify the imbalanced gender distribution at work places by diversifying the business structure and by developing service branches as well as the availability of services. In Finland, the supply of basic services is a special responsibility of the municipalities. The purpose of the measures aiming at promoting know-how and education is to attach attention to the possibilities and interest in rural occupations of both girls and boys.

The amended Equality Act (1023/2008) entered into force at the beginning of 2009. The scope of application of the provisions in the Equality Act on prohibition of countermeasures and compensation was broadened to also cover suppliers of generally available goods and services. Efficient sanction can now be imposed on suppliers of goods and services that are guilty of discrimination prohibited in the Equality Act, in the last resort by instituting proceedings for compensation. Also legal remedies were extended to cover prohibited discrimination. The reform also broadened the obligation of employers to provide clarifications on procedures considered discriminatory pursuant to section 10 of the Equality Act. The obligation to provide clarifications now concerns all situations pursuant to Section 8(1) of the Equality Act as well as the prohibition on countermeasures and harassment at working places.

The Government adopted an Equality Programme in July 2008 to promote and coordinate measures aiming at improving gender equality. The programme focused on mainstreaming the gender perspective, bridging the gender wage gap, promoting women's career advancement, increasing equality awareness in schools and alleviating segregation, improving reconciliation of family and work responsibilities, decreasing violence against women, strengthening the resources for equality work as well as the compilation of an Equality Report. A joint ministerial monitoring group compiled the final report. It was published on 15 April 2011. The report also contains well formulated measures to promote equality

The Government has also endeavoured to continue shrinking the wage gap to at most 15 per cent by 2015. In order to realize this goal, the Government will initiate two wide-ranging research projects. One of the projects covers the impact of the structural change and the changing needs of working life on the employment of women and men, their position on the labour market, integration into the labour market, career development, continuation at work and division of care responsibilities. The other project covers the impact of gender preconceptions and expectations on training and career choices. The Government is also committed to continuing its efforts for the reconciliation of family responsibilities and work by, inter alia, developing the family leave system such that the leaves earmarked for fathers are increased. The Government promotes a well functioning reconciliation of family responsibilities and work to promote new working models.
Statistics on persons having participated in formal training do not indicate any decrease in the share of women. For instance, the share of women and men starting training preparing for vocational complementary training have not changed considerably during the period 2005 to 2009. Women and men start the training in almost equal numbers. The share of women who have started studies for a polytechnic degree as adults has varied during the period 2005 to 2010 between 59.4 and 62.8 per cent (in 2010, 62.8 per cent). The share of women having started specialized polytechnic studies or higher polytechnic studies is clearly bigger than that of men. In the Seniors’ University, a special form of the Open University, the share of women was 76.4 per cent of the 17 258 students in total in 2009.

Adult education benefits were renewed for both unemployed and employed persons in 2010. Unemployed are given the possibility to study in voluntary training without losing their unemployment allowance in cases where it has been agreed as part of the job-seekers job-searching plan or employment plan. In 2010, this possibility was used and studies were initiated by 12 500 persons, 62 per cent of them women. Lifelong learning is supported by lifelong guidance. The Ministry of Education and Culture as well as the Ministry of Employment and the Economy are responsible for the steering of this guidance as a public service. The progress of studies and career and training choices are supported also by various steering and support measures. In addition, the Ministry of Education and Culture has a joint working group for the period of 2010 to 2013 on Lifelong steering. The task of the joint working group is to elaborate strategic objectives for lifelong learning. One of the starting points for the work of the working group is to improve the possibilities of all citizens to obtain guidance services.

The objective of basic education has been to guarantee equal learning opportunities for all. In education, attention is paid to different learners according to their aptitude and intelligence, regardless of gender. The student and student counselling are considered important for the advancement of equality.

The working group for the alleviation of segregation, appointed by the Ministry of Education and Culture in September 2009, proposed 25 measures to alleviate segregation in education and training. The objectives concern all forms of training. The objective is for equality and non-discrimination to be promoted actively and practices preventing equality to be dismantled in the curricula, education, steering and the working culture of the schools (concluding observations, para. 24). The teaching practices of schools and learning institutions are developed in such a way that they support the equal and individual learning and growth of pupils and students, taking into account the social and cultural structure of gender. All students are offered equal opportunities to acquire the information and skills needed in society and working life. Girls and boys are supported through education and student counselling in such a way that they are able to make choices of subjects, studies and career based on their individual attributes, strengths and motivational factors - not gender.

According to the Equality Report, the gender-based wage gap is still a central equality issue in the Finnish society. The Governments have continued together with the labour market organizations the Equal Pay programme, initiated in 2006. The programme continues until 2015. The main objective of the programme is to shrink the gender-based wage gap from the level of 20 per cent in 2006 by at least five per cent until 2015. The progress has been slow. In order to specify the measures, the Government will initiate two large research projects. The average monthly earnings of women were 81.8 per cent of the earnings of men in 2010, while the corresponding figure was 80.9 per cent in 2007 (annex 13).

A new method for promoting equal pay was laid down in the Government programme, namely a commitment to support, with the means of an increased State subsidy, such pay settlements in the municipal sector, that improves the competitiveness of the wages of female dominated occupations. The amount of the increased subsidy depended on how well it was allocated to trained female dominated sectors, where the wages were not congruent with the level of demand of the work. The agreements for the municipal sector concluded in 2007 did contain an appropriation to equalize wages, where the raises were somewhat bigger for female dominated occupations than for other groups. The Government allocated 150 million euro yearly to improve the wages of the occupations in the municipal sector dominated by women. Also the municipal agreement of 2010 did allocate some higher raises to female dominated, relatively low wage professional groups.

Besides supporting the equal pay allocation of the municipal sector, the Government has actively strived to bridge the wage gap through an equal pay programme. The programme promotes, inter alia, the use of fair and encouraging pay systems and an increased use of assessment of the demands of the work, alleviation of gender segregation of labour markets, increasing the share of women in leading positions, reducing the prevalence of temporary contracts, improving the quality and quantity of equality plans for workplaces as well as encouraging an even more balanced distribution of family leaves between the parents.

The status of women with an immigrant background is in many ways still weak in regard to language, education and labour market integration. The weak status of women with an immigrant background may partly be explained by existing internal norms of the minority communities regarding the status of women. The Ombudsman for Minorities has deemed it necessary to analyse the status of women with an immigrant background more systematically.

The new Act on the Promotion of Integration (1386/2010, hereinafter the Integration Act) entered into force on 1 September 2011. In the drafting of the Act, special attention was attached to the ways in which the status of immigrant women could be improved in society and working life. The scope of application of the Act was broadened compared to the earlier act. The Act also contains measures for the improvement of the integration, both into the society and into working life, of immigrant women who are outside of working life. The integration of immigrant women who have faced violence and their children is supported through the Act by special measures. As a consequence of the Act, increased and more diverse information on Finnish society, working life, the service system as well as the rights and duties of citizens are distributed actively and in various languages to immigrants.

The Integration Act contains provisions on individual integration plans. Integration plans are elaborated for job seekers registered at an Employment and Economic Development Office and for persons receiving municipal income support as well as to other persons in need of an integration plan. In certain cases, an integration plan may also be elaborated for families. In those cases, the plans must take into account the contents of the individual integration plans. According to the Act, the integration programmes elaborated on the local level jointly by various authorities and organizations should cover, as a separate item, violence against women and its prevention.

The new Act on the Reception of Persons Seeking International Protection (746/2011) entered into force on 1 September 2011. The act strives to take into account, better than before, the situation of persons who are in the most vulnerable situation. The Act requires that the special needs of persons seeking international protection, persons receiving temporary protection and victims of trafficking are specifically taken into account. Special needs are assessed by social care and health professionals as soon as possible after the initiation of a case. In practice, the work is generally initiated within a week from the arrival of the person at a reception centre. Also the personnel of reception centres are obliged to inform the authorities if they notice possible special needs among the clients. Accommodation and other services at reception centres shall be organized in such a way that persons that are in a particularly vulnerable situation feel as safe as possible.

In Finland, the municipalities are responsible for the integration of immigrants. Projects related to social welfare and health care services for immigrants have been carried out and good practices have been developed in the municipalities. In 2010, a project was initiated to analyse and monitor the health and functioning of working aged immigrants, both employed persons and persons outside the labour market, as well as to identify the needs for and impact of development activities that maintain and promote employment. The target group of the project is 3000 adults with a Russian, Somali or Kurd background in six cities. The project ends on 31 December 2012, after which results will be available.

In the Internal Security Programme, attention has been attached to increasing the security of immigrants and other vulnerable groups. For instance, several measures are being prepared for the identification of honour violence, intervention in it and its prevention, such as training programmes for authorities. The report of the cross-sectoral working group appointed by the Ministry of the Interior on the development of training for authorities to identify honour related violence was presented in the spring of 2011. The report contains a proposal for organizing training in two stages. The basic training would be targeted to all authorities and the advanced training according to profession. It is proposed that the costs be covered from the State budget

On 1 March 2011, a new benefit, the guarantee pension, was introduced in Finland, to secure the smallest pensions to a reasonable level. Guarantee pension is paid to a person whose total pension is below the amount of the guarantee pension. Thus, the guarantee pension secures the income level for such persons, who only receive national pension or both national pension and a small earnings-related pension. Guarantee pension is also paid to immigrants whose pension, due to a short period living in Finland or a low income level, would become so low that they would need to apply for income support. The full amount of the guarantee pension is 687.74 euro per month and it is adjusted in accordance with changes in the national pension index.

The Immigration Policy Programme of the Government Programmes 2003-2010 aimed at zero tolerance for racism. The status of women with an immigrant background is in many ways still weak in regard to language, education and labour market integration. The weak status of women with an immigrant background may partly be explained by existing internal norms of the minority communities regarding the status of women.

By means of the monitoring system of integration and ethnic relations developed at the Ministry of the Interior, data is collected regularly on the state of integration, for instance on the living conditions, employment, training and participation of immigrants. Data is also collected by gender. The National Institute for Health and Welfare also has an ongoing research project gathering information on the health, well-being and service experiences of immigrants, and on factors that influence these. In addition, statistical data is also collected according to the mother tongue of persons in vocational training. In all vocational training forms, the share of women with another mother tongue than Finnish, Swedish or Sami is bigger than that of men (annex 1).

The unemployment rate of persons with an immigrant background is almost quadruple in comparison with that of the main population. Especially the poor education of refugee women compound their employment situation. The attitude of employers and customers to the dress of especially women with a Muslim background has become an obstacle for employment. Some of the obstacles for employment of immigrant women are also caused by internal norms of the minority communities.

By means of the appropriation, the Sami may have an influence on the realization of the services that are provided for them, as well as on their contents and the ways of how they are organized and thus direct the maintenance and development of their language and culture. It is mainly the municipalities that are responsible for the production of services in Sami languages. Some services are also produced by organizations providing outsourced services. The appropriation has been used, inter alia, to arrange daycare, employ home care, primary nurses as well as family workers of child welfare, village workers, care workers, an activities instructor and a nurse. However, the social welfare and health care services in Sami are not sufficient and bilingual specialists are not always available. There is a lack of material in Inari and Skolt Sami.

Representatives of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health and the Sami Parliament negotiated in December 2009, inter alia, on the funding of social welfare and health care services in the Sami language, the funding of Sami projects, publishing activities, occupational health services for reindeer herders and on the conclusions and recommendations of the Committee to decrease violence against Sami women. The Sami Parliament stressed the traditional difficulties of the Sami to speak with others about issues belonging to the realm of the family. Speaking to outsiders is easily seen as bringing shame on the whole family. Non-violence training should start at the earliest stage possible.

A three-year project is currently being realized in the Sami region with the aim of improving the general availability and quality of services through cross-border cooperation between Finland and Norway. The project especially emphasises services provided in the Sami language. The most important measures of the project are related to specialized health care and basic (preventive) health care, day care for children and child welfare as well as services for elderly persons and persons with disabilities. The project analyses in particular the norms guiding the services as well as the knowledge of the procedures for guidance and decision-making in both countries.

The Ministry of Education allocates a yearly appropriation of 250 000 euro to support Sami culture and activities of Sami organizations. In accordance with the principles of Sami autonomy, it is the Sami Parliament that decides on the distribution of the subsidies. The appropriation is distributed as subsidies for the activities of organizations, for cultural projects and as personal grants for artistic activities related to Sami culture. In recent years, the overwhelming majority of applicants for and recipients of grants have been women. The Ministry of Education provides separate support to an art event of Sami youth, as part of the nationwide Young Culture art event.

General Recommendation 19","- Intensify efforts to eliminate discrimination against women with disabilities, combat violence against them and to recognise them as a particular group with particular needs",Implemented,"A disability policy programme was adopted in 2010 for the years 2010 to 2015. The objective of the programme is to secure a fair position for persons with disabilities in society by addressing the problems they experience through concrete corrective and development measures. The programme contains measures covering all policy fields, divided into 14 substance areas relevant for disability policy. The programme contains 122 concrete measures to correct existing difficulties.

The disability policy programme also contains studies to be carried out on special education provided on the basis of disability in 2014 and 2015. The number of students in vocational special training has increased considerably in recent years. In 2010, approximately 20 900 of the students in basic education were in special education. Access to education for the most severely handicapped has been promoted clearly in recent years by developing the network of providers of vocational special education as well as by increasing the number of admission places. The increase in the total volume of vocational training (a total of 11 700 new study places in 2008 to 2010) has also promoted access to training by persons whose need for assistance is smaller than that of persons with the most severe disabilities. For reasons of privacy protection, adequate statistical data on special students is not available, for instance, for the evaluation of multiple education. The lack of adequate statistical data compounds the assessment of the real educational needs.

Since there is a great risk that women with disabilities are completely excluded from working life, or they receive a small salary, efforts are made to advance their employment through measures of several authorities, inter alia, by subsidized pay work, traineeships, working life training and work testing. No studies on the employment of women with disabilities have been carried out in Finland. The employment of persons with disabilities could be facilitated further by subsidies to employers for modifications of working conditions.

The Action Plan to Reduce Violence against Women for the years 2010-2015 contains measures especially tailored to improve the conditions for and facilitating the provision of assistance to women with disabilities having faced violence. The measures include a guidebook with examples to facilitate identification of violence against women with disabilities. In 2014 to 2015, two studies will also be realized on the need of women with disabilities for assistance to cope after violence. The purpose is to analyse the prevalence and forms of violence experienced by women with disabilities as well as, based on the experience of women with disabilities, the type of help they need.

Through the YES Project, coordinated by the Ministry of the Interior, various measures for the promotion of equality of persons with disabilities have been realized. Examples of realized measures include an empowerment programme aimed at disability organizations as well as a guidebook for employers on the employment of persons with disabilities or persons with partial ability to work.

The ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is being prepared in a working group appointed in May 2011, whose term expires at the end of 2013. The ratification of the Convention is among the objectives of the Government Programme of Prime Minister Katainen.

In vocational upper secondary education and training there were 18 261 special students in degree programmes, 7 365 women and 10 896 men.

In Finland, approximately 60 per cent of working age persons with disabilities are employed. The number is smaller than the European average.

Government Decision No. 463-2013 amending GD 831-2000, Enabling Regulation for the Law to Prevent, Punish and Eradicate Domestic Violence, established that the National Coordination Office for the Prevention of Domestic Violence and Violence against Women (CONAPREVI) will operate in coordination with the Ministry of the Interior (MINGOB), through the Office of the Third Vice-Minister in charge of Violence and Crime Prevention. It also expanded coverage by including the Secretariat against Sexual Violence, Exploitation and Trafficking in Persons (SVET) and the Office for the Defence of Indigenous Women (DEMI), which is being relaunched in view of the importance attached to it at the highest level of Government.

Congress is in the process of approving a decree establishing that the minimum age for marriage be 18 for men and women, with exceptions allowed at 16 years of age for well-founded reasons and a competent judge’s order. It is worth underscoring that acceptance of de facto unions between minors will not be allowed.

However, article 173 and 173 bis of the Criminal Code, which characterizes the offences of sexual assault and rape, remains in effect with respect to the punishments of between 8 and 12 years of prison for those who have sexual relations with minors (under 14 years of age).

Through Decision (Acuerdo) No. 136-012, the Office of the President of the Judiciary and Supreme Court of Justice (CSJ) established the Labour Management Directorate, charged with monitoring procedures put in place in the Labour and Social Insurance Courts to implement international agreements and treaties ratified by Guatemala and to avoid discrimination in the workplace.

Through Decision No. 31-2011, CSJ and the Judiciary established the First and Second Labour and Social Insurance Courts, which are responsible for implementing procedures to safeguard proper and prompt administration of justice. They are the courts charged with hearing first claims from workers who have no professional counselling and women’s cases.

The Law for Healthy Maternity and its enabling regulation, Government Decision No. 65-2012, were approved in Decree No. 32-2010. They set out to establish the legal framework for implementing mechanisms to improve the health and quality of life for women and new-born infants; promote human development by providing women with universal, timely and cost-free access to information and quality services with a gender and ethnic perspective before and during pregnancy, birth, and the postpartum period, in order to prevent and gradually eradicate maternal and neonatal mortality.

That law contained the following provisions: (a) it amended article 25 of the law taxing alcoholic beverages to read that “of the tax collected, at least 15 per cent shall be allocated to MSPAS programmes dealing with sexual and reproductive health, family planning and alcoholism, and of that percentage, 30 per cent shall be allocated to the purchase of contraceptive inputs, pursuant to article 19 of Decree No. 87-2005”; (b) article 28 read: “failure to comply with the provisions of this Law shall be punished in accordance with the provisions of the Penal Code and special criminal laws”; (c) article 29, on penalties for common-law spouses reads: ”the man cohabiting with the woman shall permit, promote and facilitate her having access to maternal and neonatal health care services. If he does not and that gives rise to consequences amounting to crimes, those crimes shall be prosecuted and punished in accordance with criminal law.”

Article 21 of this Law requires mandatory and immediate reporting of maternal and neonatal deaths. Such occurrences must be recorded on a daily basis in the Health Information Management System (SIGSA). The regulations governing the System are to be found in Government Decision No. 65-2012. They apply to all health services at each of the three care levels provided by MSPAS. They are also binding for services provided by the Guatemala Social Security Institute (IGSS) and apply to its affiliates and beneficiaries, as well as to services provided by non-governmental organizations hired under the Coverage Expansion Programme and to private for-profit and non-profit institutions.

Despite progress made with legislation on behalf of women, that legal framework still has to be widely disseminated so that women can be empowered and have a basis on which to demand compliance with those laws. For that to happen, the justice system needs to be strengthened financially so that specialized coverage can be expanded geographically to attend to women’s demands that the law be enforced nationwide.",Legislation/policy change,Upper middle,Y,,,,,,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
GUATEMALA ,2009,2017,"Articles 1, Article 2","""educational programmes on the Convention, including its Optional Protocol, as well as programmes on women’s rights be designed and introduced, in particular for legal professionals, including judges, lawyers, prosecutors and law enforcement personnel, and for the public at large""",Partial,"Between 2009 and 2014, Guatemala’s School of Judicial Studies ran 25 basic legal training programmes for members of the judiciary and paralegals nationwide, as well as for the Comprehensive Care for Victims (SAI) teams.

They engaged in continuous and mandatory awareness-raising and training activities for officials working in the Free Legal Counselling Programme for Women Victims of Violence and Members of Their Families, on topics relating to women’s human rights and special laws. They currently have trained Mayan interpreters working in 15 of 36 offices nationwide.

In 2008-2010, with the support of OHCHR, DEMI and CODIRSA implemented the project entitled “Contributing to the eradication of racism and ethnic and gender discrimination, particularly against indigenous women”, financed by the Federal Republic of Germany. It pursued two courses of action: (a) raising social awareness and helping to shift attitudes towards respect for cultural diversity by highlighting discrimination to which indigenous women are subjected; and (b) helping to strengthen mechanisms for preventing and punishing ethnic and gender discrimination. During that period, attorneys and notaries were hired, especially by DEMI, to steer, attend to and follow up on racial discrimination cases.

In that context, an awareness-raising and training programme was developed in 2010 geared to staff in the Ministries of Education and Health and in the judiciary, aimed at generating knowledge and developing conceptual, procedural, and attitudinal capacities and skills that might help bring about changes in the way Government officials behave when dealing with or taking decisions in the course of their duties regarding indigenous women and put an end to racist and discriminatory attitudes towards them.

126.	Adoption of the strategy for the advancement of women and the national plan for Security Council resolution 1325 (2000).

In a letter from the Cabinet Secretariat on 10 July 2013, the former Prime Minister directed all government institutions to appoint widows, grant them soft loans and allocate housing units at a 75 per cent discount, with the balance to be paid by easy instalment. Cabinet Decision No. 99 (2015) directed ministries to nominate a proportion of women to senior positions (general manager level and above).
131.	Cabinet Decision No. 178 (2014) exempted widows receiving in excess of the support allowance from having to refund the balance.
132.	Cabinet Decision No. 254 (2016) discriminates positively in favour of women vis-à-vis the minimum monthly support allowance, which is set at 225,000 dinars for women compared to 175,000 dinars for men.
133.	A detailed study was conducted into the twin issues of women’s health and education and the outputs were incorporated into the National Strategy for the Advancement of Iraqi Women.
134.	The Department of Women’s Empowerment is working in coordination with the Ministry of Planning to mainstream women’s issues, needs and modalities of empowerment in the national development plan which Iraq will shortly launch. Furthermore, the Government has striven to mainstream women’s empowerment in its poverty reduction strategy, which is currently being updated.
135.	Gender units in the ministries and bodies not linked to a ministry seek to include the gender issues in the policies of their institutions.
136.	At a time when their presence in the public sphere is growing and they are becoming active politically, economically and in social movements, women are becoming increasingly visible, too, in the workforce. This is an objective reflection of increased female enrolment in education and a genuine triumph for the empowerment of women in Iraq. Note that national development plans, sector-based strategies and policies adopted by the Ministry of Planning, affirm the stipulation in the 2005 Constitution regarding the provision of equal educational, employment and health opportunities for men and women without discrimination as a right for all, while focusing on vulnerable groups such as widows, divorcées and orphans. Under the poverty reduction strategy, 11,090 loans were granted by the Department of Social Protection for Women (Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs) between 1 December 2012 and 27 December 2016; 24,033 loans were granted to small income-generating enterprises between 24 November 2013 and 30 June 2017; 370 industrial service loans were granted between 1 October 2015 and 30 June 2017; and 388 loans for community rehabilitation projects were granted between 2007 and 30 June 2017.  
137.	The Department of Social Protection for Women provides care for women who have lost their provider, including widows, divorcées and orphans, wives of missing persons and the infirm through a range of empowerment programmes:
138.	Economic empowerment:
	•	Paying allowances regularly every two months instead of every three, targeting poor families in particular;
	•	Providing family income support by arranging for beneficiaries to teach the skills in which they were trained and providing them with the necessary resources to do so, in collaboration with local and international organizations and donor bodies.
139.	Social empowerment:
	Psychological support programmes run by the Social Research Section, in coordination with UNFPA; this has involved:
	•	Establishing psychological support centres in six governorates (Baghdad, Karbala, Najaf, Babil, Salah al-Din and Diyala);
	•	Organizing psychological support sessions in these centres to coincide with the 16-day campaign against gender-based violence;
	•	Providing psychological support services in displaced persons camps from the beginning;
	•	Welcoming and listening to female victims and offering psychological support programmes designed to re-establish their social equilibrium and relieve psychological trauma;
	•	Enrolling beneficiaries in training courses and workshops to upgrade their capacities and encourage them into the job market.
140.	Psychological support services have been provided by the Ministry of Labour centres in several governorates (Baghdad, Karbala, Najaf, Babil, Salah al-Din and Diyala) since February 2016. A special section for abused women has been opened and attempts are made to find solutions to the problems these women face.",Resource allocation and investment ,Upper middle,Y,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
IRAQ,2014,2018,Article 10(h),"Effectively address the obstacles preventing the access of girls to education by, inter alia, enhancing security on the roads to schools and ensuring that schools are protected by law enforcement officials; combat harmful practices such as child marriage and provide scholarships to girls affected by poverty",Partial,"The 2014–2018 Government Programme seeks to develop the efficiency of educational and research institutions on the premise that education is the fundamental driver of social advancement, that all Iraqis have the right to education and higher education and that Iraq must strive to develop its citizens’ capabilities, restore public confidence in the educational establishment and ensure that graduates are qualified to play an active role in society. The aim is therefore to improve the standard of teaching institutions and staff, introduce modern educational technologies, address the shortage of schools and move towards vocational, technical and knowledge-based education in order to meet labour market needs.
220.	The system of double shifts in schools has to be ended. The natural increase in student numbers can be absorbed and a healthy environment ensured by building new schools and upgrading others across the country, as well as by: 
	(a)	Developing the higher education and scientific research infrastructure to absorb the surge in demand in the governorates, determining the intake capacity of each institution and adhering to the design plan;
	(b)	Completing construction of buildings on schedule, introducing next generation technologies and improving the efficiency of the higher education and scientific research system for the benefit of all;
	(c)	Promoting scientific research by building a material base and specialist laboratories; 
	(d)	Providing students and teaching staff with the resources needed for science teaching and learning; creating a virtual library;
	(e)	Keeping abreast of online and technological developments in education and including computing in the curriculum;
	(f)	Encouraging private educational institutions and stimulating investment to ensure higher standards;
	(g)	Restructuring teacher training institutions to ensure quality;
	(h)	Amending the Compulsory Education Act, extending its scope to intermediate schooling;
	(i)	Fostering the literacy for empowerment initiative;
	(j)	Continuing the educational initiative programme.
221.	The Iraqi Government, in the form of the Ministry of Education, is determined to reduce the official dropout rate at primary and secondary school levels by means of parallel education. Thus the primary school dropout rate fell from 36 per cent in school year 2004–2005 to 1.8 per cent in 2012–2013, rising to 2.2 per cent in 2015–2016. The secondary school dropout rate fell from 3.1 per cent in 2004–2005 to 2.4 per cent in 2012–2013, rising to 3.4 percent in 2015–2016.
222.	The Ministry of Education directed education departments to standardise class size in order to curb dropout by reducing overcrowding in classrooms and ill-discipline among pupils. 
223.	The Ministry of Education directed school administrations to monitor pupils to raise their academic level and prevent failure, which is one of the causes of dropout.
224.	To prevent pupils with psychological and social problems from dropping out, the Ministry of Education directed education departments to provide counselling to support families, teachers and pupils.
225.	A positive education project has been implemented to determine the causes of violence and change the behaviours that give rise to dropout.
226.	“Your right to education” centres were opened to register male and female students between the ages of 10 and 18; the number of female students stood at 827.
227.	Implementation of the Compulsory Education Act in monitored.
228.	The role of the media in increasing levels of enrolment is promoted.",Legislation/policy change,Upper middle,Y,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The Labour Act (law No. 37, 2015), which came into force on 7 February 2016, defines direct discrimination in article 1(25) as “any distinction, exclusion or preference based on race, colour, sex, religion, denomination, opinion or political belief, origin or nationality.” Article 1(26) defines indirect discrimination as “any exclusion, distinction or preference based on sex, age or health situation, economic or social status or trade union affiliation or activity, which has the effect of nullifying or impairing equality of opportunity or equality of treatment in employment and occupation”. 
235.	Article 2 of the Act seeks to secure decent work for everyone without discrimination, while Article 4 stipulates that “work is the right of every citizen capable of working, and the State shall endeavour to provide work on the basis of equal opportunity, without any kind of discrimination.” Article 6 (4) refers to the elimination of discrimination in employment and occupation. Article 8 (1) prohibits any transgression or violation of the principles of equal opportunity and equal treatment for whatever reason, in particular discrimination between workers, whether it be direct or indirect discrimination, in all matters relating to vocational training, recruitment or the terms and conditions of employment.

236.	Article 10 of the Act makes reference to the criminalisation of sexual harassment in the workplace, making it a punishable offence.
237.	Article 11 of the Act stipulates: (1) A worker subjected to any form of forced labour, discrimination or harassment in employment and occupation has the right to resort to the Labour Court to file a complaint; (2) Violation of the provisions of this section relating to child labour, discrimination, forced labour and sexual harassment shall be punishable by a term of imprisonment of not more than six months and/or a fine of not more than 1 million dinars, as the case may be.

In 2012, in partnership with the NGO Groupe Développement, the Office for Mass Education and Civics Teaching (OEMC) provided training for 200 teachers in the capital and in Mahajanga on how children can protect themselves against sexual exploitation. These teachers then passed on the knowledge to 3,000 pupils.
In 2013 as part of the implementation of the BABEO programme of assistance to women entrepreneurs, financed by the European Union, 80 women were trained by the OEMC in the sphere of combating violence against women.
To assist women to become economically independent, enabling them to escape from trafficking and sexual exploitation and also to be able to keep their daughters over the age of puberty in school, women’s associations and groupings have been equipped by UNDP as part of the implementation of the programme for increased participation by women through improving the exercise of their civil and economic rights. Three action zones were targeted, namely Farafangana, Manakara and Mananjary. The women belonging to each grouping were provided with support which made it possible for them to pursue small-scale businesses such as pig-breeding, rice-growing, raising of chickens or breeding of fish. The income obtained enabled them to keep their children at school, avoiding the risk of their being exposed to trafficking and sexual exploitation.
Finally, in 12 of the island’s regions, women were enabled to take advantage of training on agriculture, raising of livestock and craft activities provided by the Malagasy Observatory on the Use of Vocational and Entrepreneurial Training (OMEF) at the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013, in order to create independence for rural women who are not yet receiving social benefits.",Access to justice (legal aid and legal protection),Low,Y,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Once this halt had been decided, the Government of Saudi Arabia submitted a proposal for a bilateral agreement relating to the migration of domestic workers.
In addition, Madagascar has requested technical support from the International Organization for Migration directed towards: improving the draft reform of Act 2007-038 against trafficking in persons, establishing a national mechanism to combat trafficking in persons, trainer training, capacity-building for those responsible for the implementation of laws having to do with combating trafficking in persons.
As regards prevention measures, and in order to create informed awareness in the populace on the danger of trafficking and sexual exploitation of children for commercial ends, films have been produced and broadcast on the national and local public and private television channels on the different forms of trafficking and sexual exploitation of children for commercial ends both at global level and in the country and on the procedure for bringing the matter before the courts, the punishment meted out to traffickers and the rehabilitation of victims including their social reintegration. 
To prevent exploitation through prostitution of women and girls, awareness-raising sessions have been held by the Anti-Vice and Minors Protection Police, in cooperation with personnel of the Professional Association of Qualified Social Workers of Madagascar (SPDTS) and volunteers from the Fokontany belonging to the association Fiantso.
In 2011-2012, the following projects were carried out: Raising of awareness of pupils’ parents at 32 educational establishments; Raising of awareness of the population of 45 Fokontany; Raising of awareness of the management of 15 hotels; Systematic monitoring in night clubs, gambling establishments and video establishments.

This free phone call is nation-wide, and alerts the AntiVice and Minors Protection Police.
As regards prosecution and suppression measures in relation to trafficking and sex tourism, the State is encountering certain obstacles. Namely, despite the training carried out since 2007 it has to be admitted that prosecution and sentencing and the provision of compensation to the victims occur only rarely. The victims are afraid to complain to the competent authorities, owing to lack of knowledge of their rights, shame, or fear of reprisals by the perpetrators.

This removes any ambiguity as to the interpretation of FGM as well as any negative customary, cultural or social practices that undermine the physical integrity, health or dignity of the child.

Article 12 of the Code of Criminal Protection of the Child criminalises and punishes any attack on the genital organ of a female child, by infibulation, numbing or by any other means resulting in harm to the child. The penalty is increased when the perpetrator is a member of the medical or paramedical profession.

The bill on combating violence against women and girls, approved by the Council of Ministers, punishes female genital mutilation and all other practices harmful to the health of women and girls.

The national reproductive health program has included a component on repairing fistulas into society through income-generating activities and the provision of material assistance.

The National Health Information System takes charge of fistula cases in the collection of routine data.

FGM was taken into account in the 2007 MICS surveys; 2011; 2015 and by the EDS questionnaire being finalized.

Health professionals were the pioneers in the fight against FGM in Mauritania and it was through their declaration that the clerics issued two fatwas (opinions of Muslim jurists) prohibiting FGM, one national and one sub-regional. Several staff awareness workshops were organized.

The NIHR may issue statements on the rights of and discrimination against women in the Netherlands and has taken over the responsibility of the Equal Treatment Commission for assessing complaints of discrimination against women.

Both these conferences took the empowerment of women as their central theme. In 2013 a series of activities was organized by the Foreign Affairs Department of Aruba to promote and commemorate the 65th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Aruba. These activities included lectures provided for the Kiwanis Club of Aruba and Kiwanis Palm Beach, service organizations that carry out projects to promote the welfare of children in Aruba. The Department of Foreign Affairs of Aruba also hosted a debate on gender equality in Aruba in partnership with the University of Aruba’s Debating Society. Students from various institutions of higher education were encouraged to get involved, with the aim of promoting critical discourse in the Aruban community, starting with college students, and of increasing participants’ awareness of gender equality issues. In September 2013, CEDEHM opened an art gallery where clients can exhibit and sell their work. The aim is to promote the participants’ economic independence and self-reliance. Most of the women belonging to the first “Breaking Chains” support group (eight women) are also involved in the art gallery. The gallery is open during office hours.                                                                                                                                                                                    The islands of Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba (""the Netherlands of the Caribbean""): The government programme “Green Light” for 2011-2015 contains the equal opportunities policy of the Public Body of Bonaire and seeks to promote the full participation, interaction and inclusion of sections of society deemed to merit special attention. Women, including single mothers, are defined as such a group. The Executive Council sets out to correct the formation of distorted images of women and to improve the position of women in Bonaire’s society. Combating domestic violence and the dominant gender ideology is a priority here. Gender refers to the socially constructed differences between men and women in every age and in every culture. The Youth and Family Centre seeks to strengthen the role of fathers in the family and in society through parenting support programmes geared towards ending the segregation between the sexes. The aim is to produce direct results in terms of reducing the number of single mothers and reducing domestic violence.

By simplifying the allowances for parents with children, the government is addressing the poverty trap for single parents, of which 95% are women. After all, it should pay to work. The government has also earmarked extra funds for poverty reduction — €20 million in 2013, €80 million in 2014 and, from 2015, €100 million a year. Individuals not receiving the full old-age pension, and with little or no other income, may be eligible for a supplement under the Work and Social Assistance Act. The Social Insurance Bank administers this supplementary income provision scheme for the elderly (AIO).Special attention has been devoted to women and girls from ethnic minorities in labour policies, who were encouraged to participate in society by doing volunteer work. For example, through the Eigen Kracht (On Your Own) and Tafel van Een (Table for One) projects.

Aruba: New legislation was introduced in 2010 to strengthen the position of the most vulnerable groups in our society. Changes included a 25% increase in monthly welfare benefits and the introduction of a school allowance for children whose families are benefit recipients. Disability benefit recipients were also allocated an additional monthly allowance. More women than men received a monthly welfare allowance. . Modernized labour law legislation came into effect on 1 April 2013. No substantial amendments were made to the provisions relating to maternity leave and pay, as detailed in the previous report. Likewise, the provisions prohibiting discrimination in the workplace in connection with marriage, pregnancy, childbirth or maternity leave in accordance with the Convention are still in force. The duration of paid paternity leave has been set at two days. The responsibility of employers to ensure that no employee is exposed to conduct or actions that undermine the employee’s dignity has now been expressly regulated. This applies inter alia to acts of sexual harassment in the workplace.                                                                                                                            Curaçao: the school meal project provides warm lunches and transport for around 630 underprivileged schoolchildren, but also has a development component which enables 35 women between the ages of 20 and 60, who are unemployed and/or on benefit, to gain work experience. It also gives 13 older women (45 to 70 years) the opportunity to do volunteer work, for which they receive compensation. The Social and Economic Initiatives project (SEI), launched with Dutch cooperation funds, aims to tackle social and economic problems, with a special focus on social and economic development for vulnerable groups. Several focused specifically on young girls and women and all the initiatives included women and/or girls. Examples include a vocational school for teenage mothers (2008-2010) preparing them for the labour market, and intramural guidance and assistance for young women within a home setting. The Compulsory Youth Training (SVP) project, for which the Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sport (OWCS) is responsible, targets young people in the 16-24 age group who have no basic qualification and/or work. As of 1 October 2014 the project should be fully financed from regular government funds, and its implementation should be embedded within ministerial agencies, the aim being to ensure sustainability. The SVP was launched as a pilot project in August 2013.  In the period between January 2010 and June 2013 a total of 192 young people successfully completed an SVP programme. Between 70% and 80% of the young people enrolling were girls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               St Maarten: During the previous reporting period, St Maarten had established a mediating committee comprising members representing unions, employers’ organisations, and the government. The committee was charged with improving the dialogue between the social partners and, by extension, social and economic conditions on St Maarten. The committee promised to address issues arising from seasonal employment and short-term contracts and to set up a committee that would carry out periodic reviews touching on areas such as training, migrant workers, youth unemployment, and cost-of-living adjustments. Protection will thus be extended to include those employed as domestics, in hotels, in care and guidance capacities, and as vendors, many of whom are women.",Governance and coordination,High,Y,,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

It has been decided that an impact analysis should be conducted for the part of the Kingdom in the Caribbean — where the Convention will also apply — to identify the implications and steps required for further implementation of the Convention on the islands. Work is also underway on the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, as announced in the coalition agreement.

NETHERLANDS,2010,2014,"Article 2, Article 3",Ensure that substantive provisions of the Convention are fully applicable in the domestic legal order.,Not implemented,"The State Report notes that since CEDAW entered into force in the Kingdom of the Netherlands on 22 August 1991, the Netherlands has been obliged to comply with the obligations under the Convention. Provisions of treaties that have “direct effect” under article 93 can be invoked by an individual and their application can be legally enforced if needs be. As a result, it is not generally possible to state how the provisions of the Convention are reflected in the domestic legal order. This depends on the extent to which the provisions have direct effect on the basis of articles 93 and 94 of the Constitution. Provisions that do not have any direct effect will, where necessary, have to be transposed into national law. The Convention’s substantive provisions are incorporated into domestic law in this way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The main items of legislation in the Netherlands banning discrimination against women are article 1 of the Constitution and the General Equal Treatment Act and the Equal Treatment (Men and Women) Act. Article 1 of the Constitution provides an important basis for combating discrimination. The ban on discrimination in the Dutch Constitution has been implemented in six specific Acts of Parliament, including the General Equal Treatment Act and the Equal Treatment (Men and Women) Act. Since 2009 a number of changes have contributed to the reinforcement of equal treatment legislation in general and the position of women in particular. They include the amendment of the General Equal Treatment Act to adapt it to European Equality Directive (Directive 2000/78/EC) definitions of direct and indirect discrimination in the law. Another change concerns differences in life insurance premiums based on gender-related actuarial factors, which have been banned since 21 December 2012, as a result of a judgment by the EU Court of Justice. The Equal Treatment Decree was amended in response to this judgment on 21 December 2012. ",Legislation/policy change,High,Y,,,,,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

This allows individuals in the Netherlands to submit complaints to the Committee concerning violations of statutory obligations under the convention. The Committee did not find any violations of the Convention in individual complaint procedures until March 2014, when the Committee for the first time ever concluded in an individual complaint procedure that the Convention had been violated by the Netherlands.

In the Netherlands there is no statutory right of complaint for individual employees. However, this does not mean that employees have nowhere to go with their complaints. Any employee who feels that he or she has been discriminated against can submit a request for investigation to the NIHR. The NIHR will investigate the complaint and evaluate whether the actions contravened equal treatment legislation. The NIHR’s complaints procedure is publicly accessible. There are no costs associated with the procedure. Employees can also report their complaint to one of the anti-discrimination agencies, which can mediate in efforts to resolve the complaint or support the employee in further procedures before the NIHR or the courts.

The Platform’s objective is to promote the interests of persons with disabilities, on the basis of the core principles of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Social Affairs Department supports the Platform. In 2012 the Platform acquired formal status with the signing of a cooperation agreement. Although the Platform does not confine its efforts to helping women with disabilities, it certainly focuses on this group, primarily because such persons occupy a vulnerable position in society.

A number of specific campaigns and measures have been launched to raise awareness of the causes of violence against women and to strengthen young people’s relational resilience. An example is the WE CAN Young campaign, (part of the international WE CAN end all violence against women campaign). Central government reached agreement with 15 municipalities on the launch of WE CAN Young projects. The idea is to get as many people and organisations involved in order to create a critical mass that can change attitudes towards women. To achieve this, WE CAN Young works with so-called changemakers, coalition partners and ambassadors. The campaign provides young people with the opportunity to design and implement their own actions, raising their awareness and building their resilience to unacceptable behaviour and violence, and enabling them to inspire others.

An example is the WE CAN Young campaign, (part of the international WE CAN end all violence against women campaign). The Ministries of Education, Culture & Science and Health, Welfare & Sport are promoting strategies that use social media to strengthen young people’s sexual resilience. For example, a social media tool has been developed which shows young people how resilient they are, and provides them with customised advice, with links to services provided by the Municipal Health Services and www.sense.info. Prevention and increasing young people’s resilience both help stop the intergenerational transmission and violence. The government has commissioned a study of national and international interventions that may contribute to preventing intergenerational transmission of violence, with a focus on interventions relating to equal treatment and parenting support and the positive role men can play. The results are expected in the spring of 2015. With the adjustments to the attainment targets for primary education, special education and secondary education, sexuality and sexual diversity became compulsory items on school curriculums as of 1 December 2012 (or 1 August 2013 in the case of special secondary education).

The new targets give schools scope to devote attention to girls’ and boys’ sexual development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Aruba: In 2007, several Aruban NGOs joined forces to set up a national platform for persons with disabilities. The Platform’s objective is to promote the interests of persons with disabilities, on the basis of the core principles of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Social Affairs Department supports the Platform.                                                                                                                                                                                    Curaçao: Since the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010, the islands of Curaçao and St Maarten have both reaffirmed their commitment to anti-discrimination principles. Article 3 of the Constitution of Curaçao prohibits discrimination on grounds of (among others) gender in Curaçao. Under article 2:61 of the Curaçao Criminal Code inciting others to discrimination is an offence. Supporting discriminatory activities is an offence (article 2:63), including in the performance of official duties, practising a profession or running a company (2:64). Every individual living in Curaçao has access to the courts to combat discrimination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         St Maarten: Chapter 2, § 2, Article 16 of the Constitution of St Maarten states: ‘Everyone in St Maarten shall be treated equally in equivalent circumstances. Discrimination on the grounds of religion, belief, political persuasion, race, skin colour, sex, language, national or social origins, membership of a national minority, wealth, birth or any other ground whatsoever is prohibited.’ St Maarten has drafted a gender-neutral constitution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The islands of Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba (""the Netherlands of the Caribbean""): The government programme “Green Light” for 2011-2015 contains the equal opportunities policy of the Public Body of Bonaire and seeks to promote the full participation, interaction and inclusion of sections of society deemed to merit special attention. Women, including single mothers, are defined as such a group. To improve the situation for gay and transgender people on the islands, LGBT organizations decided to pool their resources and signed what has been dubbed the “Pink Orange Agreement”. It serves as the basis for a multi-year project to be carried out together with the gay rights organization COC Netherlands and seeks to strengthen the local LGBT community by creating opportunities to meet, as well as by increasing expertise and disseminating information. The Equal Opportunities Minister is providing this project with financial support.

Dutch policy also stipulates that an asylum application must be assessed with particular attention to “gender”, in the sense of the social interpretation of masculinity and femininity. In Dutch asylum practice, a woman may be regarded as a refugee if, for example, persecution as defined in the Refugee Convention occurs in her country of origin because the woman has violated discriminatory social customs, religious rules or cultural standards for women or the woman has violated laws that are at odds with universal human rights. A woman at risk of genital mutilation can also qualify for international protection. Persecution within the meaning of asylum law may apply to domestic violence if the violence is prompted by one of the grounds of persecution mentioned in the Refugee Convention and if the authorities are either unwilling or unable to offer the victim protection. Whenever the woman in question claims discrimination, consideration is given to whether the discrimination can be regarded as persecution as defined in the Refugee Convention. This will be the case if the discrimination imposes such restrictions on the victim’s existence that it is impossible for her to function in society.",Legislation/policy change,High,Y,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The Minister of Education, Culture and Science is responsible for coordinating implementation by the Netherlands of the UN CEDAW and the Beijing Platform for Action and represents the Netherlands internationally regarding matters relating to gender equality and equal opportunities. From 1995, the year in which the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action were adopted, gender mainstreaming has been the main pillar supporting policy.

NETHERLANDS,2010,2014,"Article 2, Article 3, General recommendation 19",Ensure that the specificities of domestic violence targeting women be fully taken into consideration in the formulation of the new plan of action against domestic violence starting in 2011.,Partial,"In 2012, an action plan specifically targeting child abuse was launched for the 2012 to 2016 period. A task force has been appointed to monitor implementation of the action plan, drive activities forward, and ensure that preventing child abuse occupies, or continues to occupy, a prominent place on the agendas of all the parties involved. Responsibility for preventing child abuse and providing victims with assistance is to be delegated to the municipal authorities. Every municipality will be required to set up a Domestic Violence and Child Abuse and Neglect Advice and Support Centre responsible for advising both professionals and people close to the victims, and investigating suspected cases of child abuse and domestic violence. The legislation regulating decentralisation of youth care services will also include quality assurance measures which are important in dealing with cases of child abuse. The government is building on the policies pursued in the past few years. Given the frequency and gravity of incidences of domestic violence, vigorous action still needs to be taken. The current approach rests on three pillars: 1) strengthening the position of victims and potential victims (prevention, recognition, shelter, assistance and after-care); 2) targeting the perpetrators; and 3) breaking through intergenerational transmission of violence. It encompasses all forms of domestic violence, from child and partner abuse, sexual violence and abuse of the elderly, to female genital mutilation, honour-related violence and forced marriage. The Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport is responsible for coordinating the government-wide approach, together with the Ministries of Security & Justice, Education, Culture & Science and Social Affairs & Employment. The main priority is to strengthen the leading role played by the municipal authorities, with the aim of achieving a future-proof local and regional system to tackle domestic violence, regardless of the victim’s age, gender, sexual preference or ethnic background. The State Report includes domestic violence statistics. The government has therefore commissioned a gender scan to gain a clearer understanding of the degree to which policy and the approach to domestic violence is genuinely gender-sensitive, and how account needs to be taken of this. This study, a summary of which is annexed to the State Report, was completed in January 2014. It led to the conclusion that policy is not explicitly gender sensitive. The study then went on to issue recommendations on the government’s role, monitoring and research, awareness-raising, adjustment of policy and instruments and the role of the municipal authorities. It also recommended entering into dialogue with the CEDAW Committee. In this report, the government gives its initial response to the study. In the autumn of 2014, it will discuss the conclusions and recommendations with municipal authorities, people working in the field and civil society organisations, and will then decide on the actions needed to make policy and its implementation more gender-sensitive.                                                                                                                                                                                           The domestic violence prevention project was launched in the summer of 2012, and will run to the end of 2014. The Association of Netherlands Municipalities and the Federation of Shelter Organisations are responsible for this project, together with other parties such as MOgroep, an organisation of employers in the social sector, and the national umbrella organisations of the Municipal Health Services and Youth Care Services. The project targets all forms of violence in the domestic environment, including domestic violence, honour-related violence, and child abuse. The aim is to strengthen municipal authorities’ policy strategies through, for example, regional plans describing their policies on specific issues such as child abuse and domestic violence. This will lead to greater cohesion at local level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                In 2009, the Temporary Domestic Exclusion Order Act entered into force. Under this act, perpetrators of domestic violence may be excluded temporarily from their homes, so that the victims may continue to live there. The mayor of the municipality in question is responsible for implementing the provisions of the legislation, which has proved successful in triggering cooperation between the professionals involved. In the four years since the legislation came into force, 11,692 temporary domestic exclusion orders have been issued in the Netherlands. The recent evaluation of the effects of the legislation shows that domestic violence is less likely to recur after a temporary exclusion order.       The police and the Public Prosecution Service will be focusing sharply on the investigation and prosecution of cases of domestic violence. Under a programme to improve the performance of the criminal justice system, the Ministry of Security and Justice is taking wide-ranging action to minimise the undesired outflow of cases. Measures include establishing procedural arrangements between the police and Public Prosecution Service, increasing the knowledge and expertise of intake staff, improving the quality of criminal complaints and official reports, and investing in the quality of assistant public prosecutors.

The stricter regulations should enhance oversight and control of the industry, and help tackle abuses. After publication of the legislation, local authorities will need several months at least to adapt their own regulations.                                                                                                                                        For the past two years the Ministry of Security and Justice and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment have subsidized an organization that is researching the needs of prostitutes, ways of identifying and combating abuse and the possibility of setting up a self-help organization or pressure group. Prostitutes can access information in many ways on work-related health issues, support for victims of abuse, their rights and obligations as independent workers or employees, support if they wish to leave the industry etc. Some organizations visit prostitutes at work to provide counselling and information. Cities like Utrecht, Amsterdam and The Hague have specific centres where prostitutes can go for information and support. Further, throughout the Netherlands several programmes exist which provide help for prostitutes who want to stop working in the sex industry. The website www.prostitutiegoedgeregeld.nl provides information in many different languages for prostitutes working in the Netherlands. Improvement of the position of prostitutes in the Netherlands is one of the topics being addressed as part of a national programme in which local authorities and government ministries are working together.                                                                                                                Prostitution will be an area for special attention in the efforts to improve the position of women in the Netherlands in the Caribbean. This does not only involve the position of — foreign-born — prostitutes, but also preventing violence against local women. Several ministries (Security and Justice, Interior and Kingdom Relations, Social Affairs and Employment) are involved in the policy area of prostitution. An interministerial working group has been established to set up an structural prostitution policy, in close collaboration with the authorities on the island. Maintaining security and public order, countering human trafficking and the protection of the rights of the prostitute are the pillars of this policy. In 2013, the Department of Public Health started preparations for an exploratory survey entitled “Commercial sex workers in Aruba” to be conducted in 2014. The purpose of the survey is to collect information on the knowledge of — and attitudes towards — HIV/AIDS, to determine the risks of club-based and street sex workers, to assess the level of human trafficking among commercial sex workers, and to develop effective outreach programmes and policy recommendations.",Access to justice (monitoring and evaluation),High,Y,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Everyone has the right to a life without violence and a fair chance to participate. Measures were taken to prevent discrimination, and more severe penalties were introduced. The government placed more of the responsibility on companies, social institutions and men and women themselves, limiting its own role to areas where equal treatment was a non-starter, and where safety and participation were both under threat.                                                                                                                Both the Equal Treatment (Men and Women) Act and the General Equal Treatment Act contain provisions banning sex discrimination. Under the provisions of the Civil Code, contravention of equal treatment legislation may also constitute an unlawful act. The Working Conditions Decree requires employers to assess and evaluate the risks of psychosocial work-related stress, and to take the necessary measures. Employers are also required to inform and instruct employees about these risks and the relevant measures. It is an offence for employers not to pursue adequate policies, for which the Social Affairs and Employment Inspectorate may impose a fine.

The latest survey was conducted by Statistics Netherlands in 2012, and related to figures over 2010. Studies over the years 2008 and 2012 show that women still earn less on average than men. However, the pay gap, i.e. the difference between the average gross hourly wages earned by men and women is shrinking. More than 50% of the pay gap is due to the fact that women in the Netherlands mainly work part-time. However, none of the models used in the studies can fully account for discrepancies in hourly wages. There always remains an unexplained discrepancy, identified as ‘the corrected pay gap’. Wage disparities between men and women must be interpreted with the necessary caution, and cannot always be attributed to discrimination. There are various instruments (e.g. the Wage Indicator and management tools) that enable both employers and employees to look into possible wage gaps. The State Report includes further statistics on the pay gap in the public and private sectors.                                                                          The State Report outlines some further statistics about the progress that has been made in achieving equality for women in the Netherlands. Despite the economic crisis, the percentage of economically independent women rose slightly from around 47% to more than 48% between 2008 and 2012. Men were hit harder by the crisis, and the percentage of economically independent men dropped from around 70% to 67% in the same period.                                                    The Netherlands Institute for Human Rights carried out a study of the gender wage gap in hospitals. The main cause turned out to be that salaries were set on the basis of factors that had nothing to do with the value of the work, such as last earned salary, salary negotiations etc. It is important to identify these factors to ensure workers are paid a fair salary. The aim is to share the results of the study and the new approach with other sectors. The Institute is currently in talks with the Ministries of Social Affairs & Employment and Education, Culture & Science on plans to carry out a supplementary study of the wage gap in two other sectors in 2014.                                                                                                                                           The Report includes data on discrimination on the work floor, including the number of complaints about aggression, violence and harassment submitted to the Social Affairs and Employment Inspectorate in the 2010 to 2012 period. A study conducted by the predecessor of the Netherlands Institute for Human Rights shows that 45% of women who became pregnant or gave birth in the period between 2007 and March 2011 and worked or sought work during and after their pregnancy were the possible victims of discrimination. From the report of the study, it can be concluded that women were not always aware of their rights and duties in relation to their pregnancy. The Institute’s recommendations to the government mainly relate to adequate information provision. A database can now be accessed on the central government website listing all the rules for pregnant women. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment also plans to supplement the information on dismissal and pregnancy that is now available on the government website for employers.

The “Gender and Health Alliance” has drawn up a strategic plan for awareness raising, teaching and research, with the aim of launching a widely supported programme in two years’ time. This is being done in consultation with the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment. The initiative will also tie in with other innovative developments, such as the interministerial National Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Programme, which focuses on a healthy start (parenting and education), housing and life in healthy neighbourhoods in healthy surroundings, healthy working, health protection and disease prevention in the healthcare sector.

NETHERLANDS,2010,2014,"Article 2, Article 3, General recommendation 19",Netherlands Antilles and Aruba to promptly enact legislation providing for temporary restraining orders to be imposed on perpetrators of domestic violence.,Implemented,"The Netherlands: In 2009, the Temporary Domestic Exclusion Order Act entered into force. Under this act, perpetrators of domestic violence may be excluded temporarily from their homes, so that the victims may continue to live there. The mayor of the municipality in question is responsible for implementing the provisions of the legislation, which has proved successful in triggering cooperation between the professionals involved. In the four years since the legislation came into force, 11,692 temporary domestic exclusion orders have been issued in the Netherlands. The recent evaluation of the effects of the legislation shows that domestic violence is less likely to recur after a temporary exclusion order.                                                                                                                                                                                                        Aruba: A new Criminal Code for Aruba was approved by parliament on 18 April 2012 and adopted by the Government of Aruba on 27 April 2012. The provisions governing stalking, assault and orders barring persons from entering certain areas of the island (gebiedsverbod) in the new Criminal Code are virtually identical to the corresponding provisions in the new Criminal Code of Curaçao. Any person who commits common assault, serious assault, premeditated assault, assault intentionally inflicting serious bodily injury on another person, or assault with the use of weapons is liable to a term of imprisonment or fine. Article 2:277 provides for a one-third increase in the term of imprisonment if the assault was committed against (inter alia) the spouse or partner. Someone who has been convicted of stalking is liable to a term of imprisonment or a fine. A new addition is the court’s power to impose an additional penalty on a person found guilty of stalking or assault, in the form of an order barring him from entering a particular area. The new Criminal Code entered into force as of February 2014.                                                                                                       No new developments can be reported in relation to the Temporary Domestic Exclusion Orders Bill mentioned in the fifth CEDAW report. The Bill is still awaiting debate in Parliament.                                                                                                                                      Curaçao: Under article 26 of the Constitution of Curaçao the government is required to protect the family and to take measures to promote a healthy family life. Under article 27, it is the duty of the government to protect young people. Under Curaçao’s revised Criminal Code, where (serious) assault is committed with premeditation or serious bodily injury is intentionally caused to another person, the maximum sentence may be increased by a third if the victim of the offence belongs to certain categories of people such as the offender’s mother, father, spouse or partner, a child for whom he bears parental responsibility or a child whom he is caring for and raising as a member of his family. As an additional sentence the court may impose a restraining order on him barring him from entering certain parts of the island (gebiedsverbod). A restraining order prohibiting contact (contactverbod) may also be imposed for other forms of assault.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          St Maarten: St Maarten has complied with the recommendation to enact legislation providing for temporary restraining orders to be imposed on perpetrators of domestic violence. Under article 317, paragraph 1 of the current Penal Code, if the victim of domestic abuse falls within the definition of the abuser’s ‘spouse’, the law treats this as an aggravating factor. Ipso facto, the Penal Code allows a temporary restraining order to be imposed on suspects and defendants in domestic violence cases, even if the public prosecutor decides not to proceed any further with prosecution. Under the new Penal Code, adopted on 13 December 2012 but not yet in force, the definition of a ‘victim of domestic abuse’ has been extended to include persons living in a variety of domestic circumstances, for instance the perpetrator’s partner or companion. In addition, whereas in the past domestic abuse of a child could only legally occur between a child and its parent, the legal definition of child abuse has now been extended to include abuse perpetrated by a guardian against a child for whom he/she is legally responsible. This extends a blanket of legal protection, thereby mitigating any ambiguity in the application of Article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.",Access to justice (responses and remedies for injustice),High,Y,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

Its purpose is to combat violence against women and protect their human rights by upholding their right to a life free from violence, in accordance with the principles of equality and non-discrimination. 

The legislative branch is focusing on mainstreaming gender equality and dignity in legislation. To that end, amendments were passed in 2015 to its Organic Law, under article 2 of which its mission is to represent Nicaraguans by adopting an intercultural, generational and gender equity approach to legislation and incorporating inclusive language when drafting such laws, as well as legislative decrees and resolutions.

The Family Code stipulates that society and the State have an obligation to protect, develop and strengthen the family through the bonds of love, solidarity, assistance and mutual respect. It addresses the best interests of the child, female heads of households, the protection of the family home and the equal rights and responsibilities of men and women. It guarantees the protection, respect and restoration of the human rights of all families.

From 2002 to 2010, the national police had its own gender department and a handbook of duties that incorporated institutional advances and modernization and provided guidance on gender-related responsibilities. 

In 2015, the Special Police Unit for Women, Children and Adolescents merged with the Legal Cooperation Directorate; as a result, it has been possible to capitalize on experience, good practices, specialized personnel and technical resources and offer a better service and greater proximity to communities.

The campaign “A home is built with love ... because in love there is no fear” was launched in 2015 and the “Good hope, good heart” campaign was launched in 2016. The aim of both campaigns is to make families stronger and prevent violence against women and girls by promoting values, gender equity and complementariness and by encouraging the participation of men and boys in caregiving and household tasks.

During the period 2010–2018, the Ministry trained 24,536 women a year in innovative and creative strategies, promoting entrepreneurship as a means for women to achieve autonomy and economic empowerment in traditionally male-dominated trades.

The comprehensive service model provides comprehensive support to victims of domestic and sexual violence and prevents and investigates trafficking in persons. 

In the judicial branch, 75 courts specializing in family affairs, violence and adolescence were expanded and strengthened, together with the judicial facilitators system and the Institute of Forensic Medicine with its women and children’s clinics and the DNA laboratory. 

Following the entry into force of Act No. 779, the specialized courts responsible for hearing, processing and ruling on such offences dealt with 136 charges of femicide, 79 of which resulted in a conviction. The remaining cases are in process or are pending due to a lack of cooperation from the defendant. A total of 101,439 criminal cases involving violence against women went to trial and rulings on 67,101 of them have been handed down. The remainder are in process or are being settled through mediation. 

Between 2011 and 2018, Nicaragua, through its Ministry of Youth and in compliance with the regulations relating to the Equal Rights and Opportunities Act, trained 131,024 women in technology, preventive health, psychosocial care and associative arrangements. A total of 240,648 grants for pursuing technical studies, undergraduate, postgraduate and national and international master’s degrees were awarded to young women with limited resources. Women make up more than 50 per cent of those mobilized to support families in social crisis and to participate in recreational, sports, cultural, environmental and communication activities.

Programmes have been launched to ease access to capital for women organized in solidarity groups by granting them loans at fair interest rates and providing goods and production inputs to strengthen their economic entrepreneurship and production capacities. The Usura Cero (Zero Usury) microcredit programme financed 510,454 loans between 2007 and 2018. In 2007, a food production programme was set up to reduce poverty and hunger among rural families by providing capital for productive assets. From 2007 to 2016, 282,797 vouchers were issued to women in rural areas. Both programmes are characterized by a true gender-sensitive approach and thus contribute to reduction of the gender gap, to women’s economic empowerment and to household food security. 

The Human Trafficking Prevention Act (No. 896) was promulgated in 2015.

A judicial observatory on gender-based violence was established in 2014 by means of an inter-agency agreement. Its purpose is to follow up on and monitor the application of precautionary and protective measures and judicial decisions and statistics relating to violent crimes against women by conducting specialized studies such as the statistical yearbooks on gender-based violence 2013–2017 and the studies of judgments handed down by courts of first instance in femicide cases in 2013, 2014 and 2015.

Special Police Units for Women had been operating in Nicaragua since 1996 to support women, children and adolescents in situations of domestic and sexual violence. In 2006, this became a national specialism when the Directorate of the Special Police Unit for Women and Children was created (provision 023/06). In 2007, investigation, prevention, information and criminal analysis were enhanced. The work of the special units received national and international recognition in 2012. All psychologists have specialized as forensic psychologists and all social workers have received specialist training in social inquiry. The network of promoters and volunteers has been expanded, with 4,080 trained in prevention and victim support at 162 of the Special Police Units for Women and Children. In 2014, a new model of mobile police units for women, staffed by multidisciplinary teams of experts, was implemented to expand access to justice for victims of domestic and sexual violence. 

The Criminal Code (Act No. 641) gives legal recognition to injuries resulting from psychological harm, makes domestic violence a separate offence, punishes sexual exploitation, pornography and paying for sex with adolescents, prohibits and punishes all forms of sexual exploitation, including tourism for purposes of sexual exploitation, punishes procuring and pandering as separate offences and prohibits the use of mediation, suspended sentencing and other benefits in cases where a sexual offence has been perpetrated against children or adolescents. The Comprehensive Prevention of Violence Against Women Act (No. 779), amending the Criminal Code (Act No. 641), was passed in 2012.

The Committee notes with a deep concern, however, the high prevalence of domestic and sexual violence against women and girls, including women migrant domestic workers, in the State party. It is further concerned about the gaps in legislation on violence against women, in particular the lack of a specific law criminalising domestic violence and marital rape; barriers to gaining access to justice for women domestic workers who are victims of violence; the lack of awareness and training on violence against women among judges, prosecutors, police officers and health professionals; and the absence of a data-collection system on cases of violence against women, as well as on prosecution and conviction rates and on the number, capacity and funding of shelters, counselling and rehabilitation services.

(a)	The vulnerability of women and girls recruited as domestic workers to become victims of trafficking and the implications of the sponsorship system, which restricts domestic workers’ ability to change employers and prevents them from filing complaints, thereby increasing their vulnerability to abuses, including forced labour;

While noting that a number of policy, legislative, administrative, victims empowerment and other measures, based on a multi-sectoral approach at the operational level, have been put in place to combat violence against women in the country, the Committee expresses serious concern at the inordinately high prevalence of sexual violence against women and girls, and widespread domestic violence.

It is further concerned at the low levels of prosecution and conviction, and at reports indicating that some police officers fine rape perpetrators in lieu of reporting the cases.

The Committee notes with concern that statistics on the number of women and girls who are victims of trafficking for sexual and economic exploitation are not available, in light of the fact that prostitution is criminalized. It is also concerned at the State party’s failure to address the root causes of trafficking and prostitution, including poverty, which impedes the State party’s efforts to address these issues in a serious way. In addition, the Committee regrets the lack of information provided on the existence and implementation of regional and bilateral memoranda of understanding and/or agreements with other countries on trafficking, and the inadequate information provided on prosecution and punishment of traffickers.
",Implemented,"The Prevention and Combating of Trafficking in Persons Act, 2013 (Act No. 7
of  2013)  was  promulgated  in  2013.  The Act  is  a  single  statute  that  tackles  human
trafficking  holistically  and  comprehensively  by  providing  a  maximum  penalty  of
R100-million or life imprisonment or both in the case of a conviction. The legislation
fulfils the objectives to: (i) provide for an offence of trafficking in persons and other
offences  associated  with  trafficking  in  persons;  (ii)  to  prevent  and  combat  the
trafficking in persons within or across the borders of the Republic; (iii) to provide for
measures to protect and assist victims of trafficking in persons; (iv) to provide for the
establishment  of  the  Intersectoral  Committee  on  Prevention  and  Combating  of
Trafficking in Persons; and (v) the criminalisation of practices resulting in forced and
early marriages and harmful cultural and traditional practices such as Ukuthwala. The
Act also gives effect to the domestication of the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress,
and Punish Trafficking in Persons.

29. While acknowledging the significant increase in the number of women in Parliament, diplomacy, and decision-making positions within the public administration as a result, inter alia, of temporary special measures in accordance with article 4, paragraph 1, of the Convention, the Committee notes that the same level of progress has not been achieved, and that obstacles to the advancement of women still remain, in other areas of public and professional life, as well as in decision-making positions, including in the judiciary, local government, trade unions and the private sector. 
",Partial,"South Africa has seen a number of women taking up leadership positions at the

However, the Committee is concerned about the persistence of discrimination against women in the labour market, in particular the high rate of unemployment affecting women (30 per cent), the wide gender/wage gap, and occupational segregation. The Committee also regrets that even though the Employment Equity Act (1998) and the Equality Act (2000) prohibit discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy, and the Basic Conditions of Employment Act (1997) protects maternity leave, there is no provision in domestic legislation for remunerated maternity leave.",Implemented,"The Employment Equity Act, 1998 (Act No. 55 of 1998), has been amended by
the  Employment  Equity  Act,  2013  (Act  No.  47  of  2013).  The  amendment  has
explicitly  incorporated  the  concept  of  equal  pay  for  work  of  equal  value,  into  the
unfair  discrimination  provisions  and  aligns  the  Act  with  the  International  Labor
Organization prescripts. This stipulates that it is unfair for an employer, based on a
prohibited  ground,  or  analogous  arbitrary  ground,  to  have  different  terms  and conditions of employment for employees doing the same work. Provision is now made in the Act for the Minister, after consultation with the Commission for Employment Equity, to  issue  regulations to prescribe  the criteria  and  methodology  for  assessing
work of equal value.42 Furthermore, all cases of sexual harassment can be arbitrated
irrespective of earnings.

31. The Committee notes with appreciation the measures undertaken by the State party in the area of education, including the National Education Infrastructure Management System, the National School Nutrition Programme, the Girls Education Movement (GEM), and the development of the Guidelines for the Prevention and Management of Sexual Violence and Harassment in Public Schools. The Committee is concerned that teenage pregnancy is the most common reason why girls leave school, resulting in high drop-out rates, and it is further concerned about the lack of information on re-enrolment rates after giving birth. The Committee also expresses grave concern about the high number of girls who suffer sexual abuse and harassment in schools by both teachers and classmates, as well as the high number of girls who suffer sexual violence while on their way to/from school. The Committee is concerned, in particular, at reports indicating that prostitution, exploitative sex and rape are perpetrated in connection with a child’s access to education. The Committee notes that education is key to the advancement of women, and that the low level of education of women and girls remains one of the most serious obstacles to their full enjoyment of their human rights. 
",Implemented," Government has embarked on several strategies to promote school safety as well
as enhance the implementation of the Guidelines for the Prevention and Management
of Sexual Violence and Harassment. The Guidelines  were distributed to all schools
and serve to enhance  measures to create a safe and caring school environment free
from all forms of sexual harassment and violence, as well as to assist public schools
in maintaining the minimum standard procedures for addressing allegations of sexual
violence in schools (DBE, 2010c).
